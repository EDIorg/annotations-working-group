# Contributing to the Annotations Working Group

This is a light weight developer space for anything related to the EDI Annotations Working Group. There is a single branch `main` containing all the repository content. Currently, the only requirements are that your contributions are described well enough for others to understand, and that your git commit messages provide some context for the changes being made. Thanks!
