Thus, the goals of the study changed to 1) an investigation of the method, and 2) a comparison of enzyme activities of two different soil layers from the arctic tundra. Methodological examination included the impact of toluene, used to prevent immobilization of the product, and blank correction of enzyme activity, and a search for a true 6-h linear rate of activity during a 48-hour incubation. We measured native and potential, using casein as an artificial substrate, activities as net amino acid production in mineral and organic soil layer samples. Varying toluene concentration had no clear effect on activity; omitting toluene resulted in zero native activity and reduced potential for the organic samples, but not for the mineral. Comparison of activities with and without blank correction indicated, particularly for potential activity of samples with low native rates, that correction was required for accuracy. Native and potential activity of the organic samples, and native of the mineral were linear for the first 6 h of incubation; linearity was observed during the 6 to 24 h incubation for potential activity of the mineral. Soil layer activity data indicated that native activity was higher in organic soils as compared with mineral. The organic layer potential activity was ten-fold greater than the native, suggesting substrate limitation; potential and native activities did not differ in the mineral layer, indicating substrate sufficiency. Casein addition changed the kinetic pattern for both layers from hyperbolic to sigmoidal for the mineral and linear for the organic, implying different enzyme pools or behavioral changes of existing pools. Native activity based on total soluble protein was higher for the mineral samples relative to the organic, reiterating substrate capacity differences and variations in enzyme/substrate interactions.","field method, biological process, measurement process, layer, soil, soil core, production, incubation, organic layer, soil horizon"

The MBL MEL was used to simulate the recovery of three types of tussock tundra, unburned, moderately burned, and severely burned in response to changes in climate and nutrient additions. The simulations indicate that the recovery of nutrients lost during wildfire is difficult under a warming climate because warming increases nutrient cycles and subsequently leaching within the ecosystem. The study was published in Ecological Applications (in press, 2016). This dataset is the long term archive of the results published in the paper. The full dataset has been broken into two parts because of the number and size of the files. Part 1 contains MBL MEL executable, a model description file in word, and the input files to run the simulations. Part 2 contains the output files for all simulations. Both Part 1 and Part 2 contain several different types of files. In Part 1 the comma separated ascii file included with the dataset is one of the many driver files used for the simulations. The variable descriptions below describe the variables in that file and all the driver files. In Part 2 the comma separated ascii file included with the dataset is one of the many output files from the simulations. The variable descriptions below describe the variables in that file and all the output files.

"knb-lter-arc.20049","Effects of experimentally altered wolf spider densities and warming on soil microarthropods, litter decomposition, litter N, and soil nutrients near Toolik Field Station, AK in summer 2012","Predators can disproportionately impact the structure and function of ecosystems relative to their biomass. These effects may be exacerbated under warming in ecosystems like the Arctic, where the number and diversity of predators are low and small shifts in community interactions can alter carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we show that warming alters the effects of wolf spiders, a dominant tundra predator, on belowground litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics. Specifically, while high densities of wolf spiders result in faster litter decomposition under ambient temperatures, they result instead in slower decomposition under warming. Higher spider densities are also associated with elevated levels of available soil nitrogen, potentially benefitting plant production. Changes in decomposition rates under increased wolf spider densities are accompanied by trends toward fewer fungivorous Collembola under ambient temperatures and more Collembola under warming, suggesting that Collembola mediate the indirect effects of wolf spiders on decomposition. The unexpected reversal of wolf spider effects on Collembola and decomposition suggests that in some cases, warming does not simply alter the strength of top-down effects but instead induces a different trophic cascade altogether. Our results indicate that climate change-induced effects on predators can cascade through other trophic levels, alter critical ecosystem functions, and potentially lead to climate feedbacks with important global implications. Moreover, given the expected increase in wolf spider densities with climate change, our findings suggest that the observed cascading effects of this common predator on detrital processes could potentially buffer concurrent changes in decomposition rates.","biogeochemistry, ecology, meteorology, community, animal, biological process, community process, environmental process, manipulation process, carbon, decomposition, nitrogen cycle, nutrient, biodiversity, temperature, predator, invertebrate, production, predation, decomposition, warming, nitrogen, community dynamics, trophic dynamics, arthropod, predator"

Ecosystems (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00542-3.This paper present a framework for assessing biogeochemical recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from disturbance. We identify three recovery phases. In Phase 1, nitrogen is redistributed from soil organic matter to vegetation, but the ecosystem continues to lose nitrogen because the recovering vegetation cannot take up nitrogen as fast as it is released from soil. In Phase 2, the ecosystem begins re-accumulating nitrogen and converges on a quasi-steady state in which vegetation and soil-microbial processes are in balance. In Phase 3, vegetation and soil-microbial processes remain in balance and the ecosystem slowly re-accumulates the remaining nitrogen.","biogeochemistry, ecology, ecosphere event, community, community, biological process, community process, environmental process, measurement process, carbon, nitrogen cycle, inorganic matter, nutrient, organic matter, biodiversity, disturbance, vegetation, vegetation, production, recovery, disturbance, modeling, nitrogen, inorganic nutrient, plant cover, vegetation dynammics, primary production"

An approach to modeling resource optimization for substitutable and interdependent resources. Ecological Modelling (2020). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109033. This paper presents a hierarchical approach to modeling organism acclimation to changing availability of and requirements for substitutable and interdependent resources. Substitutable resources are resources that fill the same metabolic or stoichiometric need of the organism. Interdependent resources are resources whose acquisition or expenditure are tightly linked (e.g., light, carbon dioxide, and water in photosynthesis and associated transpiration). We illustrate the approach by simulating the development of vegetation with four substitutable sources of nitrogen that differ only in the cost of their uptake and assimilation.","biogeochemistry, ecology, meteorology, community, community, biological process, measurement process, physiological process, carbon, nitrogen cycle, inorganic matter, nutrient, biodiversity, light, vegetation, vegetation, production, modeling, photosynthesis, transpiration, nitrogen limitation, nitrogen, inorganic nutrient, vegetation dynammics, primary production"

The aggregated approach can affect model predictions because grazer-mediated processes can respond differently to changes in climate from the processes with which they are typically aggregated.

These drivers,				operating at particular scales and interacting with other drivers across scales, create a				complex pattern of soil variability. Human activity may change the natural patterns of				variance by changing the scale at which the governing processes are operating or the				governing processes that are dominant at a given scale. In the case of soils and phosphorus				(P) concentrations, this may involve changing dominant forces from plant-soil interactions				and parent material to fertilizer inputs. Here, we examine the hypothesis that human				activity changes natural patterns of variance in soil P concentrations across several				spatial scales. We measured soil P concentrations and variability at 3 distinct levels of				analysis - among sites, within a field, and within a 10-m diameter plot - and across 4				management regimes - remnant prairie, lawns, cash grain farms, and dairies. Variance changed				across scale in any one management regime and across management regimes at the same scale.

Here, we examined the usefulness of urban-rural gradients (URGs), an emerging				paradigm in urban ecology, for predicting soil P concentrations across a rapidly urbanizing				agricultural watershed in southern Wisconsin. We compared several measures of an urban-rural				gradient to predictors of soil P such as soil type, slope, topography, land use, land cover,				and fertilizer and manure use. Most of the factors that were expected to drive differences				in soil P concentrations were not found to be good predictors of soil P; while there were				several significant relationships, most explained only a small proportion of the variation.

Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse				approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The				methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially				with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are				two reasons for differing conclusions. In this study, O2 and CO2 sondes were deployed during				July and August, 2000 to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes in the				Northern Highland Lake district of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The lakes				were chosen to span wide and orthogonal ranges in DOC and TP concentrations. From these				data, we calculated GPP, R and net ecosystem production (NEP=GPP-R). Over the broad range in				TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1:1 molar ratio. Metabolism				estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set				had -NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated				strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were				nearly equal, but at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had -NEP. Strong correlations				between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon				influences lake metabolism. Sampling Frequency: Chemical parameters and physical properties				sampled from 1 to 4 times during the summer. Time series data step is 30 minutes. Number of				sites: Time series data for 25 lakes.

"knb-lter-ntl.112","North Temperate Lakes LTER: Primary Production - Trout Lake Area 1986 - 2007","Crystal, Sparkling and Trout lakes are sampled approximately fortnightly throughout the        ice free period and water is returned to the lab for 3 hour in vivo incubations at ambient        temperature. On an annual rotation, one of the lakes is sampled to the bottom of the photic        zone (ie. 0.5% of surface light) while only the epilimnion of the other 2 lakes is sampled.        All samples are integrated by thermal layer and 14C uptake is deternimed at 10 light levels        using a metal-halide lamp. All samples are acidified and bubbled before liquid scintillation        counting and uptake is dark bottle corrected. DIC and chlorophyll are also measured. Each        P-I (photosynthetic uptake vs irradiance ) set is further reduced to 3 parameters (alpha,        beta, and Pmax) based on the work of Platt 1980. In addition, thermal information and lake        light transparency profiles (collected approximately fortnightly on these three LTER lakes)        along with daily incident PAR at 30 minute intervals (measured at Noble F. Lee Municipal        Airport, Woodruff, WI) provide input to a mechanistic model of lake primary productivity.        Primary productivity for a lake is calculated from productivity parameters derived from the        laboratory uptake experiments, coupled with the lakes' thermal and light regimes. 1. PI        parameters: Productivity (P), as a function of irradiance (I), is described by a hyperbolic        tangent curve with three parameters (Platt 1980). The three parameters describe the initial        slope of the curve, the I at which maximum P occurs, and the decay rate of P, following        maximum P. All three parameters are fit simultaneously to laboratory observations, using        minimization of a least squares objective function (Matlab v. 6, Mathworks, Inc.). The        parameters allow for the calculation of P, as a function of I, for a given thermal stratum        of a given lake on a given day. 2. LEC: Light extinction coefficients (LEC) for each lake        are calculated as the slope of the best fit line through the natural logs of observations of        light at depth. The light at depth data were obtained from the LTER core data set (light        profiles are sampled approximately fortnightly throughout the ice-free period on LTER lakes        3. Thermal layers: The thermal layers for the lake are obtained from the LTER core data set        (temperature profiles are sampled approximately fortnightly throughout the ice-free period        on LTER lakes). 4. Lake productivity: Productivity for a given lake on a given day is        calculated from the derived data in steps 1-3. Light versus depth is discretized for 0.5 m        depth intervals to match the lake hypsometric data. Light for each 0.5 m disc is calculated        for every 30 minutes from observed irradiance and LEC, using numerical integration through        the depth of the disc. Productivity for every 30 minutes is calculated for a disc, using the        light data applied to the parameters and equation described in #1. Productivity for every 30        minutes in the thermal layer is the sum of the disc productivities for that layer.        Productivity for every 30 minutes in the lake is the sum of the productivity of the thermal        layers. Productivity for the day is the sum of all 30 minute productivities for a given        calendar day. Hypsometrically weighted productivity is calculated by weighting each of the        discretized productivities by the hypsometric weight of that disc. 5. Interpolation: Rarely        do all observations required to calculate productivity occur on the same day. PI parameters,        LECs, and thermal layers were linearly interpolated to daily values. For any given day's        productivity calculation, all data, other than observed irradiance, were considered constant        Sampling Frequency: water samples are taken fortnightly; PAR measured every 30 minutes        Number of sites: 3 ","biogeochemistry, meteorology, aquatic, experiment, field method, model, plant part, biological process, community process, hydrologic process, manipulation process, measurement process, landform, water, chlorophyll, light, radiation, temperature, freshwater, lake, water sample, wood, production, extinction, ice, incubation, hillslope, irradiance, photosynthetically active radiation, primary production"

The primary focus of this project was to examine the difficulties faced by				livestock operations when managing manure on field systems that are fragmented by				development. A survey regarding manure management was sent to Dane County, WI farms within				the Lake Mendota watershed. The survey was conducted in two phases; March to May 2003 and				March to May 2004. This dataset and accompanying survey entitled ""Manure Management on the				Urban Fringe"" is available for users wishing to ascertain animal feeding operation size and				management patterns in the Lake Mendota watershed. The data also include the distance from				animal feeding operations to nearest urban centers via Euclidean (crow flies) and Road				Network distances. Results suggest that exurban developments exert a strong influence on				manure management routines of livestock producers. This influence is very local. Farmers in				an urbanizing setting were more likely to encounter problems during manure hauling when the				fields they were accessing were in close proximity to urban developments, regardless of				their proximity to the urban core. The distances and times required to haul manure between				the farm and the most distant field increased in the last five years. Land rental rates				steadily increased at the same time that lease lengths shortened. Cash grain land tends to				be sparse as livestock producers compete with developers for tracts on which to distribute				manure. Manure brokering is a possible strategy to monitor land availability and coordinate				manure placement between farms Cabot, P. E., S. K. Bowen, and P. J. Nowak. 2004.

Location lat/long: 43.0995, -89.4045Notable events:2017 - A boating mishap caused the loss of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind sensors between May 28 and July 11. The dissolved oxygen sensor had significant biofouling from algae and zebra mussels.2019 - A YSI EXO2 sonde was added to the buoy and includes DO, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, specific conductance, pH, fDOM, and turbidity sensors. The chlorophyll and phycocyanin sensors replace Turner Cyclops 7 fluorometers that had been in use in prior years. Both sets of sensors output RFU, but have significant magnitude differences. The YSI pH, DO, and specific conductance sensors were cleaned and recalibrated every two weeks. 2020 - Cleaning and calibration of the YSI sensors occurred nearly every week. The dissolved CO2 sensor was not operating between July 2 and September 17.2021 - Due to power and communications issues, the buoy was not operating August 22-31, and data is intermittent between November 8 and December 3. An effective method to keep the underwater PAR sensor mostly free of biofouling algae has been employed.&#13;","biogeochemistry, ecology, meteorology, aquatic, device, field method, algae, biological process, physiological process, air, chlorophyll, conductivity, oxygen, aquatic ecology, temperature, radiation, relative humidity, weather, wind, freshwater, lake, sensor, platform, production, metabolism, air, limnology, air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, wind speed, mooring buoy, primary production"

Smelt were first detected in Sparkling Lake, Vilas county, WI in 1980 and their				population has since increased dramatically. We attempt to remove rainbow smelt from				Sparkling Lake through a combined strategy of harvest and predation. If successful, such a				strategy might be employed to restore other Wisconsin lakes invaded by smelt to a more				natural species assemblage without resorting to piscicides. The data sets presented here				report the harvest component of smelt removal. An assessment of the rainbow smelt				population, supplementing annual LTER data, was performed during the late summer of 2001.				The spring removal effort began in 2002 at ice out using multiple gear types. In 2002, the				removal effort also continued from mid to late summer using horizontal gill nets. However,				from 2003-2009 we took advantage of smelt spawning behavior and our efforts were condensed				to a spring removal at ice-off and we utilized only fyke nets. The total weight of each				catch was recorded and length-weights as well as sex ratios were documented for a subset of				the catch from each removal event. The removal effort resulted in the removal of the				majority of the adult population multiple times. However, smelt are a robust species and the				population continuously rebounded from large removal years. As a result, catches have				fluctuated from 16kg to nearly two tons. We have observed an overall reduction in fish size				and an increase in the proportion of males to females.

We collected a				single set of zooplankton and water chemistry data during a one-month time window				(synchronized from south to north across the state) from an open water site in each basin as				a means to minimize and standardize sampling effort and to minimize cascading effects				arising from predator-prey interactions with resident and immigrant aquatic insect				communities. We identified 53 taxa of zooplankton from 54 sites sampled across Wisconsin.				There was an average of 6.83 taxa per site. The zooplankton species were distributed with a				great deal of independence. We did not detect significant correlations between number of				taxa and geographic region or waterbody size. There was a significant inverse correlation				between number of taxa and the concentration of calcium ion, alkalinity and conductivity.				One pair of taxa, Lynceus brachyurus and Chaoborus americanus, showed a significant				difference in average duration of sites of their respective occurrence. All other pairs of				taxa had no significant difference in average latitude, waterbody surface area, total				phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, alkalinity, conductivity, calcium ion, sulfate,				nitrate, silicate or chloride. Taxa were distributed at random among the sites - there were				no statistically significant pairs of taxa occurring together or avoiding each other.				Multivariate analysis of zooplankton associations showed no evidence of distinct				associations that could be used to distinguish lakes from wetlands. Zooplankton community				structure appears to be a poor tool for distinguishing between lakes and wetlands,				especially at the relatively large scale of Wisconsin (dimension of about 500 km). The data				suggest that a small body of water in Wisconsin could be classified as a wetland if it				persists in the spring and summer for only about 4 months, and if it is inhabited by Lynceus				brachyurus, Eubranchipus bundyi, and if Chaoborus americanus and Chydorus brevilabris are				absent.

"knb-lter-ntl.225","Zooplankton Communities of Restored Depressional Wetlands in Wisconsin - North Temperate Lakes LTER 1998","Wisconsin has lost approximately 2 million hectares of wetland since statehood (1848).				Through the combined efforts of state and federal agencies and private groups focused				primarily on wetland restoration for waterfowl habitat management or compensatory				mitigation, a fairly substantial gain in wetland area has been achieved. Much of the wetland				restoration effort in Wisconsin has occurred on formerly agricultural lands. However, due to				the nature of the past disturbance and possible residual effects not corrected by simply				returning surface waters to these lands, there is some question regarding the resultant				wetland quality or biological integrity. In an effort aimed at developing tools to measure				wetland gains in terms of quality or ecological integrity, the Wisconsin Department of				Natural Resources (WDNR) initiated a study of biological communities on restored wetlands in				Wisconsin. We report on the community of microcrustaceans and arthropods that can be				collected with a plankton net in open water in wetlands. We examined zooplankton community				structure in restored wetlands in terms of richness, taxonomic representation, and Daphnia				sexual reproduction and related these metrics to attributes on wetlands representing				least-disturbed conditions and agriculturally impacted wetlands. We sampled 56 palustrine				wetlands distributed across Wisconsin. These wetland sites were categorized as agricultural,				least-impacted, and restored (recently withdrawn from agricultural usage). The wetlands were				reasonably homogeneous in many ways, so that taxon richness was not correlated with basin				origin, presence of adjacent roads, presence or absence of fish, water chemistry, or the				size of the open water. We identified a total of 40 taxa.. We conclude that restoration of				wetland watersheds works. Withdrawal of the watershed from agricultural usage is followed by				an increase in taxon richness, and the sites resembled least-impacted sites in about 6-7				years. Dodson, S. I. and R. A.

Sampling on Lakes Monona, Wingra, and Fish started in 1995; sampling on other lakes started in 1981. Sampling is done at six littoral zone sites per lake with seine, minnow or crayfish traps, and fyke nets; a boat-mounted electrofishing system samples three littoral transects.

Derived data sets include species richness, catch per unit effort, and size distribution by species, lake, and year. Species richness for a lake is the number of fish species caught in that lake during the annual fish sampling.

We surveyed 44 lakes to describe the patterns and determinants of B. chinensis distributions in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A., and to assess the likelihood of effects on native snail communities in the invaded systems. B. chinensis was widespread among surveyed lakes (21 of 42 lakes with snails) and its occurrence was correlated with indicators of lake productivity and anthropogenic dispersal vectors (boat landings, distance to population centers, shoreline housing density). Some native snail species tended not to occur at sites where B. chinensis was abundant; among these was Lymnaea stagnalis, which suffered reduced survival in the presence of B. chinensis in a recently published mesocosm study. However, there was no difference in overall snail assemblage structure at either the site or lake level as a function of B. chinensis presence or abundance. Lake occurrences of many snail species have apparently been lost over time, but a comparison to a 1930's survey showed that there was no increased likelihood of species loss in lakes invaded by B. chinensis (or by the invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus). Although B. chinensis is widespread and sometimes abundant in northern Wisconsin lakes, it does not appear to have strong systematic impacts on native snail assemblages.

"knb-lter-ntl.262","Madison Wisonsin Lakes Zooplankton 1976 - 1994","Zooplankton of the four Yahara River chain of lakes (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa) were sampled and analyzed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) during 1976 to 1994 as part of a long-term limnological sampling program directed by Richard C. Lathrop. Methods for zooplankton sampling and laboratory analyses were previously summarized for Lake Mendota (Lathrop 1998); methods were similar for the other three Yahara lakes although Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled for zooplankton during 1976-1985. In general, zooplankton were sampled at the deepest location of each lake by pulling a conical net vertically through the water column (i.e., vertical tow sample) during 1976-1994. Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake, although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter, sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet, but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters, respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (""small net"") and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net, a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed, the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years, sugared formalin for a few years, and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net, organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL), transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample, individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer; 5-10 organisms of other cladocerans and various life stages of copepods (i.e., nauplii, copepidites, and adults) were also measured. Based on specified size criteria, juvenile and adult Daphnia of each species were recorded separately. These size criteria were given in Luecke et al. (1990) for samples collected in 1976-1989. The criteria varied in subsequent years but were generally 1.3 mm for D. pulicaria, 1.2 mm for D. mendotae, the most common Daphnia species encountered. If smaller Daphnia were encountered with eggs in their brood chamber, then the adult size was adjusted. Thus, the distinction of adult versus juvenile Daphnia densities recorded in each sample must be viewed as only an index of the two age groups. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites were counted separately as two distinct groups without regard to species or life stages. All nauplii were counted as a single group with no distinction made between calanoid and cyclopoid species. All densities and length measurements in the three subsamples were then averaged for each species' life stage. Numerical density estimates (N per meter squared) for each species or zooplankton group as reported in the data set were then computed by multiplying the average subsample count by the subsampling dilution factor (i.e., volume of sample in bottle) and then dividing by the net opening area (0.01767 meter squared). Biomass estimates for each species or zooplankton group (gram per meter squared) can then be computed using the average length (mm) recorded in the data set using length-weight relationships published in the literature. One caveat for interpreting the zooplankton data for 1976-1994 is that the net efficiency of the vertical tow net used is less than 100%, and also variable depending on the amount of algae clogging the net (Lathrop 1998). Under clear water conditions (Secchi disc greater than 8 m), the net efficiency of the small net was determined to be approximately 58%. However, net efficiency was only about 42% during a period with moderate blue-green algal densities (Secchi disc 1.8 m). The relatively small mesh size (75-80 um) of the net was initially chosen in order to capture rotifers, which are recorded in the database. Beginning in 1991 a larger 30-cm diameter (""large"") net with a 75-80 um mesh size was also used, which became the standard sampling net used in 1995 coincident with the lake sampling program being conducted by the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) Project. After 1994, the ""small"" net was no longer used for sampling zooplankton on the Yahara lakes. This data set also contains large net data for years 1991 through 1994 for Mendota and for 1994 for Monona. Leptodora counts from the small net are available for Mendota (1976-1989), Monona (1976-1987), Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Leptodora counts from the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). All Leptodora counts were performed on the entire sample by dumping the sample bottle into a container. Individual length measurements for some zooplankton sampled with the small net are available for Mendota (1988-1989, 1992-1994) and Monona (1994). Individual length measurements for zooplankton sampled with the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). Daphnia eggs counts (number of eggs per adult daphnia in the sample) from samples taken with the small net are included for Mendota (1976-1991), Monona (1976-1993 except 1989), and Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Egg counts represent the combined number of free eggs found in each subsample plus eggs still remaining in adult Daphnia as many times adult Daphnia had eggs expelled from their brood chambers once the preservative was added (especially in years when the preservative was just formalin). Once the total number of eggs for either D. pulicaria or D. mendotae was counted, then the estimate of the number of eggs per adult Daphnia was calculated while recognizing that the criteria for separating adult versus juvenile Daphnia is not without error. Thus, the number of eggs per adult number is best used as an index to determine if the Daphnia population was increasing or not growing due to food limitation.

To assess peat				C in the Northern Highlands Lake District (NHLD), a approximately 7000 square km region in				northern Wisconsin, United States, with 20 percent peatland by area, we sampled 21				peatlands. In each peatland, peat depth (including basal organic lake sediment, where				present) was measured on a grid and interpolated to calculate mean depth. Our study				addressed three questions: (1) How spatially variable is peat depth? (2) To what degree can				mean peat depth be predicted from other field measurements (water chemistry, water table				depth, vegetation cover, slope) and/or remotely sensed spatial data? (3) How much C is				stored in NHLD peatlands? Site mean peat depth ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 m. Most of the				peatlands had been formed by the in-filling of small lake basins (terrestrialization), and				depths up to 15 m were observed. Mean peat depth for small peat basins could be best				predicted from basin edge slope at the peatland/upland interface, either measured in the				field or calculated from digital elevation (DEM) data (Adj. R2 = 0.70). Upscaling using the				DEM-based regression gave a regional mean peat depth of 2.1 plus or minus 0.2 m (including				approximately 0.1 to 0.4 m of organic lake sediment) and 144 plus or minus 21 Tg-C in total.				As DEM data are widely available, this technique has the potential to improve C storage				estimates in regions with peatlands formed primarily by terrestrialization.

Effects of these changes on economically important game fishes may vary with fish				size. We investigated largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size-specific growth rates				across 16 lakes spanning the range of lakeshore residential development in Wisconsins				Northern Highland Lake District using a longitudinal multilevel model. Growth rates of small				fish had a strong positive relationship with lakeshore residential development. The strength				of the relationship decreased with length and became increasingly negative for fish longer				than 210 mm. This pattern may be driven by a release from density-dependent growth, shifts				in available prey sources, reduced macrophyte cover, or angling-induced selection pressures.				Regardless of the mechanism, our results indicate, relative to undeveloped lakes, largemouth				bass in highly developed lakes take 1.5 growing seasons longer to enter the fishery (356				mm).

Most of these data (1987-1993) precede 1995, the year that the University of Wisconsin NTL-LTER program took over sampling of the Yahara Lakes. However, WDNR data collected from 1997-1998 (unrelated to LTER sampling) is also included. In 1987 a joint project by the WDNR and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Center for Limnology (CFL) was initiated on Lake Mendota. The project involved biomanipulation of fish communities within the lake, which was acheived by stocking game fish species (northern pike and walleye). The goal was to induce a trophic cascade that would improve the water clarity of Lake Mendota. See Lathrop et al. 2002. Stocking piscivores to improve fishing and water clarity: a synthesis of the Lake Mendota biomanipulation project. Freshwater Biology 47, 2410-2424. In collecting these data, the objective was to gather population data and monitor populations to track the progress of the biomanipulation. The data is dominated by an assesssment of the game fishery in Lake Mendota, however other Yahara Lakes and non-game fish species are also represented. A combination of gear types was used to gather the population data including boom shocking, fyke netting, mini-fyke netting, seining, and gill netting. Not every sampling year includes length and weight data from all gear types. The WDNR also carried out randomized, access-point creel surveys to estimate fishing pressure, catch rates, harvest, and exploitation rates.

The model is coupled with an in-lake carbon model and simulates hydrologic flow paths in groundwater, wetlands, lakes, uplands, and streams. The goal of this modeling effort was to compare aquatic carbon cycling in two climate scenarios for the North Highlands Lake District (NHLD) of northern Wisconsin: one based on the current climate and the other based on a scenario with warmer winters where lakes and uplands do not freeze, hereinafter referred to as the ""no freeze"" scenario. In modeling this ""no freeze"" scenario the same precipitation and temperature data as the current climate model was used, however temperature inputs were artificially floored at 0 degrees Celsius. While not discussed in his dissertation, Van de Bogert considered two other climate scenarios each using the same precipitation and temperature data as the current climate scenario. These scenarios involved running the model after artificially raising and lowering the current temperature data by 10 degrees Celsius. Thus, four scenarios were considered in this modeling effort, the current climate scenario, the ""no freeze"" scenario, the +10 degrees scenario, and the -10 degrees scenario. These data are the outputs of the model under the different scenarios and include average monthly temperature, average monthly rainfall, average monthly snowfall, total monthly precipitation, daily evapotranspiration, daily surface runoff, daily groundwater recharge, and daily total runoff.

We analyzed the        supply of 10 ecosystem services for 2006 across a large urbanizing agricultural watershed in        the Upper Midwest of the United States, and asked: (i) Where are areas of high and low        supply of individual ecosystem services, and are these areas spatially concordant across        services? (ii) Where on the landscape are the strongest tradeoffs and synergies among        ecosystem services located? (iii) For ecosystem service pairs that experience tradeoffs,        what distinguishes locations that are win win exceptions from other locations? Spatial        patterns of high supply for multiple ecosystem services often were not coincident locations        where six or more services were produced at high levels (upper 20th percentile) occupied        only 3.3 percent of the landscape. Most relationships among ecosystem services were        synergies, but tradeoffs occurred between crop production and water quality. Ecosystem        services related to water quality and quantity separated into three different groups,        indicating that management to sustain freshwater services along with other ecosystem        services will not be simple. Despite overall tradeoffs between crop production and water        quality, some locations were positive for both, suggesting that tradeoffs are not inevitable        everywhere and might be ameliorated in some locations. Overall, we found that different        areas of the landscape supplied different suites of ecosystem services, and their lack of        spatial concordance suggests the importance of managing over large areas to sustain multiple        ecosystem services.

Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated				metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain				complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N)				speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping				cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In				addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic				cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by				bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake				Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing				season.

In lake-rich landscapes, streams may be important sources of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) to the atmosphere in addition to lakes, but their source strength is poorly documented. The processes which control gas concentrations and emissions in these interconnected landscapes of lakes, streams and groundwater have not been adequately addressed. In this paper we use multiple datasets that vary in their spatial and temporal extent to investigate the carbon gas source strength of streams in a lake-rich landscape and to determine the roles of lakes and groundwater. We show that streams emit roughly the same mass of CO2 as regional lakes, and that stream CH4 emissions are an important component of the regional greenhouse gas balance.

"knb-lter-ntl.308","Ebullitive methane emissions from oxygenated wetland streams at North Temperate Lakes LTER 2013","          Stream and river carbon dioxide emissions are an important component of the global carbon cycle. Methane emissions from streams could also contribute to regional or global greenhouse gas cycling, but there are relatively few data regarding stream and river methane emissions. Furthermore, the available data do not typically include the ebullitive (bubble-mediated) pathway, instead focusing on emission of dissolved methane by diffusion or convection. Here, we show the importance of ebullitive methane emissions from small streams in the regional greenhouse gas balance of a lake and wetland-dominated landscape in temperate North America and identify the origin of the methane emitted from these well-oxygenated streams. Stream methane flux densities from this landscape tended to exceed those of nearby wetland diffusive fluxes as well as average global wetland ebullitive fluxes. Total stream ebullitive methane flux at the regional scale (103 Mg C yr-1; over 6400 km2) was of the same magnitude as diffusive methane flux previously documented at the same scale. Organic-rich stream sediments had the highest rates of bubble release and higher enrichment of methane in bubbles, but glacial sand sediments also exhibited high bubble emissions relative to other studied environments. Our results from a database of groundwater chemistry support the hypothesis that methane in bubbles is produced in anoxic near-stream sediment porewaters, and not in deeper, oxygenated groundwaters. Methane interacts with other key elemental cycles such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which has implications for ecosystem changes such as drought and increased nutrient loading. Our results support the contention that streams, particularly those draining wetland landscapes of the northern hemisphere, are an important component of the global methane cycle.

"knb-lter-ntl.310","LTREB: Lake Myvatn Predation experiments at Myvatn, Iceland during 2009 and 2011","Changes in one prey species' density can indirectly affect the abundance of another prey species if a shared predator eats both species leading to positive or negative indirect effects. In some cases, indirect effects may occur when prey move into a habitat, such as when riparian predator populations grow in response to adult aquatic insects and increase predation on terrestrial prey. However, predators could instead switch to aquatic insects or become satiated, reducing predation on terrestrial prey. To determine the net indirect effect of aquatic insects on terrestrial arthropods via generalist spider predators, we conducted a field experiment using enclosures on the shoreline of an Icelandic lake with numerous aquatic midges. Midge abundance and wolf spider density were altered to mimic midge influx and a wolf spider numerical response. At all predator densities, the presence of midges decreased rates of predation on terrestrial prey. When midges were absent, predation was 30percent greater at high spider density. But when midges were present, predation of sentinel prey was equal across spider densities, negating the influence of increased predator density. In lab mesocosms, prey survivorship increased greater or equal 50percent where midges were present and rapidly saturated; the addition of 5, 20, 50 and 100 midges equivalently reduced spider predation, supporting predator distraction rather than satiation as the root cause. Our results demonstrate a strong positive indirect effect of midges, and broadly support the concept that predator responses to alternative prey are a major influence on the magnitude and direction of predator-mediated indirect effects.","biogeochemistry, ecology, aquatic, terrestrial, experiment, community, habitat, population, animal, plant part, community process, manipulation process, organic matter, biodiversity, freshwater, lake, riparian, field manipulation, mesocosm, predator, population dynamics, invertebrate, root, predation, abundance, density, enclosure, arthropod, insect, predator"

LAGOS compiles multiple, individual lake water chemistry datasets into an integrated database. We accessed LAGOSLIMNO version 1.040.0 for lake water chemistry data and LAGOSGEO version 1.02 for lake catchment geographic data. In the LAGOSLIMNO database, lake water chemistry data were collected from individual state agency sampling and volunteer programs designed to monitor lake water quality. Water chemistry analyses follow standard lab methods. In the LAGOSGEO database geographic data were collected from national scale geographic information systems (GIS) data layers. Lake catchments, defined as 'The area of land that drains directly into a lake, and into all upstream-connected, permanent streams to that lake exclusive of any upstream lake watersheds for lakes greater than or equal to 10 ha that are connected via permanent streams', were delineated for lakes greater than or equal to 4 ha. Lake-stream connectivity type was assigned to lakes greater than or equal to 4 ha using GIS tools that use the National Hydrology Dataset (See Soranno et al. 2015 for LAGOS geographic processing steps). A subset of lake and geographic data was created to examine spatial variation in TP and water color relationships with CHLa across broad geographic extents using spatially-varying coefficient models with a Bayesian framework. Lakes were selected that had complete records for summer epilimnetic total TP, true water color, and CHLa. In addition we selected lakes with surface area greater than or equal to 4 ha and less than 10,000 ha to exclude very small and very large lakes from the analyses. The resulting dataset includes 838 lakes in Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, and Maine with 7395 observations. The majority of lakes in the data subset have only one water chemistry observation (~72% of lakes). There are 228 lakes with more than one water chemistry observation taken on different sampling occasions over time (average of 29 observations per lake with repeated measures). The dataset reports the original, individual measurements. The proportion of agriculture and wetlands in the lake catchment were derived from land cover and land use data in the National Land Cover Dataset (2006). For the analyses we withheld ten percent of the observations for model validation and to assess prediction accuracy. The remaining observations were used in the model building steps. The 'dataset' column in the data indicates whether the observation belongs to the model-building ('mb') or hold-out dataset ('h').

"knb-lter-ntl.327","Lake ice seasonality over the past 320-570 years"," Lake and river ice seasonality (dates of ice freeze and breakup) responds sensitively        to climatic change and variability. We analyzed climate-related changes using direct human        observations of ice freeze dates (1443-2014) for Lake Suwa, Japan, and of ice breakup        dates (1693-2013) for Torne River, Finland. We found a rich array of changes in ice        seasonality of two inland waters from geographically distant regions: namely a shift towards        later ice formation for Suwa and earlier spring melt for Torne, increasing frequencies of        years with warm extremes, changing inter-annual variability, waning of dominant        inter-decadal quasi-periodic dynamics, and stronger correlations of ice seasonality with        atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature after the start of the Industrial        Revolution. Although local factors, including human population growth, land use change, and        water management influence Suwa and Torne, the general patterns of ice seasonality are        similar for both systems, suggesting that global processes including climate change and        variability are driving the long-term changes in ice seasonality.

"knb-lter-ntl.329","Long-term trends and synchrony in dissolved organic matter characteristics in Wisconsin, USA lakes: quality, not quantity, is highly sensitive to climate","          Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a fundamental driver of many lake processes. In the past several decades, many lakes have exhibited a substantial increase in DOM quantity, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. While increasing DOC is now widely recognized, fewer studies have sought to understand how characteristics of DOM (DOM quality) change over time. Quality can be measured in several ways, including the optical characteristics spectral slope (S275-295), spectral ratio (SR), absorbance at 254 nm (a254), and DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA; a254:DOC). However, long-term measurements of quality are not nearly as common as long-term measurements of DOC concentration. We used 24 years of DOC and absorbance data for seven lakes in the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research site in northern Wisconsin, USA to examine temporal trends and synchrony in both DOC concentration and quality. We predicted lower SR and S275-295 and higher a254 and SUVA trends, consistent with increasing DOC and greater allochthony. DOC concentration exhibited both significant positive and negative trends among lakes. In contrast, DOC quality exhibited trends suggesting reduced allochthony or increased degradation, with significant long-term increases in SR in three lakes. Patterns and synchrony of DOM quality parameters suggest they are more responsive to climatic variations than DOC concentration. SUVA in particular tended to increase with greater moisture and decrease with drier conditions. These results demonstrate that DOC quantity and quality can exhibit different complex long-term trends and responses to climate components, with important implications for aquatic ecosystems.

"knb-lter-ntl.334","LTREB experimental chironomid mesocosms at Myvatn, Iceland","          During the summer of 2014, we conducted experiments testing whether increasing numbers of chironomid larvae would increase primary production and standing chlorophyll a concentrations. We incubated experimental mesocosms with varying numbers of chironomid larvae for 12 days in July. We tested sediments for chlorophyll a concentrations, as sediments are primarily composed of benthic diatoms. We tested the oxygen production in these mesocosms. We did this by sealing the mesocosms and incubating them in Lake Myvatn for 3 hours, and taking measurements of dissolved oxygen before and after the incubations. We were also interested in whether this increase in food resources might translate to increased growth rates of chironomid larvae at high larval densities. After stocking experimental mesocosms with varying numbers of chironomid larvae, we set these mesocosms in Lake Myvatn for 12 days. We collected the larvae at the end of the 12 day experiment and obtained the average dry weights of the Chironomus islandicus larvae in each mesocosm. We hypothesized that the tubes that chironomid larvae build would be a superior substrate for algal growth, as compared to loose sediments. Because there are two taxa (Chironomus islandicus and Tanytarsus gracilentus) that are overwhelmingly dominant at our study site, we wondered whether there would be differences in this effect between the two species. We stocked mesocosms with larvae from one of the two species, and mesocosms were then incubated in Lake Myvatn. We collected sediments and larval tubes from each mesocosm and tested their chlorophyll a concentrations. We hypothesized that one mechanism that chironomid larvae might alleviate algal nutrient limitation by depositing concentrated nutrients near algae in the form of larval excretions. We collected chironomid larvae from Lake Myvatn and placed them in distilled water. We then sieved out the larvae and their fecal passings, and transported the water samples to Madison, WI, USA, where nutrient concentrations were analyzed        ","biogeochemistry, ecology, aquatic, experiment, field method, population, algae, biological process, manipulation process, measurement process, sediment, water, landform, chlorophyll, nutrient, organic matter, oxygen, biodiversity, benthos, freshwater, lake, mesocosm, water sample, diatoms, growth, production, incubation, island, primary production"

Birge and Juday directed the first comprehensive assessment of water chemistry in the NHLD, sampling more than 600 lakes in the 1920s and 30s. These surveys have been repeated by various agencies and we now have data from the 1920s (UW), 1960s (WDNR), 1970s (EPA), 1980s (EPA), 1990s (EPA), and 2000s (NTL). The 28 lakes sampled as part of the Regional Lake Survey have been sampled by at least four of these regional surveys including the 1920s Birge and Juday sampling efforts. These 28 lakes were selected to represent a gradient of landscape position and shoreline development, both of which are important factors influencing social and ecological dynamics of lakes in the NHLD. This long-term regional dataset will lead to a greater understanding of whether and how large-scale drivers such as climate change and variability, lakeshore residential development, introductions of invasive species, or forest management have altered regional water chemistry. The purpose of the macrophyte survey is to identify, and quantify the types of aquatic plants within the various 28 regional survey lakes. The macrophyte survey consists of sampling macrophyte plants using a metal rake attached to a 15ft pole at approximately 140 spatially resolved points on a lake that are spread out in a grid like fashion, equally spaced from each other. Sampling locations were chosen such that the maximum depth at which macrophytes were surveyed was equal to or less than 15ft of water. Macrophyte sampling occurs in the latter part of the summer (after July 10) to ensure that macrophytes have had adequate time to grow and our sampling efforts capture the typical summer macrophyte community in each lake.

GLM (v.2.1.8) was coupled to the Aquatic EcoDynamics (AED) module library via the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Modeling (FABM). GLM-AED requires four major scripts to run the model. First, the glm2.nml file configures lake metadata, meteorological driver data, stream inflow and outflow driver data, and physical response variables. Second, the aed2.nml file configures various biogeochemical modules for the simulation of oxygen, carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen, among others. Third, aed2_phyto_pars.nml configures all parameters pertaining to phytoplankton dynamics. And fourth, aed2_zoop_pars.nml configures all parameters pertaining to zooplankton dynamics. This dataset contains parameter descriptions and values as they were used to simulate organic carbon and greenhouse gas production on Lake Mendota in summer 2016.

No well was monitored by more than one entity so none of the wells records were merged. Third, two rounds of quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) were conducted.Wells in confined aquifers were not included in this dataset. The values of the USGS and Central Sands data are the depth to the water whereas LTER values are mean sea level elevations of the groundwater levels. These data could not be directly compared with each other.This data compilation was funded by the Wisconsin Groundwater Joint Solicitation.

Although inland recreational fisheries are thought to be highly resilient and self-regulating, the rapid pace of environmental change is increasing the vulnerability of these fisheries to overharvest and collapse. We evaluate an approach for detecting hidden overharvest of inland recreational fisheries based on empirical comparisons of harvest and biomass production. Using an extensive 28-year dataset of the walleye fisheries in Northern Wisconsin, USA, we compare empirical biomass harvest (Y) and calculated production (P) and biomass (B) for 390 lake-year combinations. Overharvest occurs when harvest exceeds production in that year. Biomass and biomass turnover (P/B) both declined by about 30% and about 20% over time while biomass harvest did not change, causing overharvest to increase. Our analysis revealed 40% of populations were production-overharvested, a rate about 10x higher than current estimates based on numerical harvest used by fisheries managers.

An important, but underappreciated, secondary value of recreational catch is its role as a source of food. This contribution is poorly understood due to difficulty in estimating recreational harvest at spatial scales beyond an individual system, as traditionally estimated from angler creel surveys. Here, we address this gap using a 28-year creel survey of ~300 Wisconsin inland lakes. We develop a statistical model of recreational harvest for individual lakes and then scale-up to unsurveyed lakes (3769 lakes; 73% of statewide lake surface area) to generate a statewide estimate of recreational lake harvest of ~4200 t and an estimated annual angler consumption rate of ~3 kg, nearly double estimated United States per capita freshwater fish consumption. Recreational fishing harvest makes significant contributions to human diets, is critical for discussions on food security, and the multiple ecosystem services of freshwater systems.

      Features at the Parcel Scale"," Accurately predicting the hydrologic effects of urbanization requires an understanding        of how hydrologic processes are affected by low-impact development practices. In this study,        we explored how growing season surface runoff, deep drainage, and evapotranspiration on a        residential parcel are affected by several low-impact interventions, including three        ""impervious-centric"" interventions (disconnecting downspouts, disconnecting sidewalks, and        adding a transverse slope to the driveway and front walk), two ""pervious-centric""        interventions (decompacting soil and adding microtopography), and all possible ""holistic""        combinations. Results were compared to both a highly and moderately compacted baseline        parcel under an average and a dry weather scenario for a temperate climate. We find that        under reasonable assumptions for highly compacted soil, pervious areas are a major source of        runoff and disconnecting impervious surfaces may be relatively less effective without        improving soil conditions. Under both highly and moderately compacted soil conditions,        combining efforts to decompact soil with impervious disconnection has a synergistic effect        on reducing surface runoff and increasing deep drainage and evapotranspiration. All        combinations of interventions enhance infiltration, but the partitioning of additional root        zone water between deep drainage and evapotranspiration depends on the weather scenario.        Importantly, when all low-impact interventions are applied together, growing season deep        drainage is higher than that from a vacant lot with no impervious surfaces. We infer that        ecohydrologic interfaces between impervious and pervious areas are strong controls on urban        hydrologic fluxes and that high-resolution, process-based models can be used to account for        these interfaces and thereby improve predictions of the hydrologic effects of low-impact        interventions.

In 2018 and 2019, ~200,000 centrarchid individuals were removed, while species-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and biomass-per-unit-effort (BPUE) were measured. Yellow Perch have increased in CPUE and BPUE, while centrarchid abundances have declined. We will continue removing centrarchids in 2021 and monitoring these populations.

Estimating the flux of solutes to and from lakes requires accurate water budgets. Evaporation rates are a critical component of the water budget of lakes. Data from the instrumented raft on Sparkling Lake includes micrometeorological parameters from which evaporation can be calculated. Raft measurements of relative humidity and air temperature (2 m height), wind velocity ( at 1, 2, and 3 m heights; but beginning in 2008, only at 2 m) ,and water temperatures (from thermistors placed throughout the water column at intervals varying from 0.5 to 3m) are combined with measurements of total long-wave and short-wave radiation data from a nearby shore station to determine evaporation by the energy budget technique. Comparable evaporation estimates from mass transfer techniques are calibrated against energy budget estimates to produce a lake-specific mass transfer coefficient for use in estimating evaporation rates. After correcting for flux to or from the atmosphere and vertical mixing within the water column, high frequency measurements of dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen can be used to estimate gross primary productivity, respiration, and net ecosystem productivity, the basic components of whole lake metabolism.

"knb-lter-ntl.422","Prairie du Sac - Sauk City, Wisconsin, monthly precipitation data","This is a compilation of total monthly precipitation data in total inches for two NOAA weather stations. The Prairie du Sac station data located at the Prairie du Sac dam on the Wisconsin River (43.31 , -89.7283) started with full monthly records being recorded in 1912 with complete monthly records through 2007. In mid-2007 a nearby station was established in Sauk City at the wastewater treatment plant (43.262 , -89.7349) with continuous data from 2008 through the present. The two stations are relatively close (about 3.25 miles apart), and both are slightly more than 4 miles to the west of the centroid of Fish Lake (Dane Co.) a core study lake in the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Project conducted by the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The compiled monthly records are based on daily NOAA precipitation records available electronically to the public. As a general practice, daily precipitation over weekends and holidays was not regularly recorded at the stations such that cumulative totals were recorded the following workweek day.  As such, while the records for each single day were not always accurately recorded, the monthly totals were generally accurate.  However, starting in 1996 at the Prairie du Sac station, because the cumulative weekend/holiday precipitation didnt allow known daily totals, those cumulate weekend/holiday records were not submitted to NOAA so they were recorded as missing data in NOAAs electronic dataset. To rectify the many months of missing data, pdfs of the original hand-written monthly submissions were retrieved from NOAAs archives such that the monthly precipitation totals could be calculated.  In the process a few transcription errors in the electronic records of other months were also corrected in this dataset as well as determining a few other monthly records that were missing. Thus, this dataset of monthly precipitation at the two nearby weather stations is complete and hopefully accurate.","ecology, meteorology, aquatic, human dominated, terrestrial, animal, plant, hydrologic process, manipulation process, aquatic ecology, precipitation, weather, freshwater, lake, stream, urban, grassland, vertebrate, precipitation, limnology, fish"
"knb-lter-ntl.423","Survey of pond habitats and aquatic diversity of Madison, Wisconsin from May to Aug 2019 and 2020 Data Set ","1) Urbanization may lead to changes in local richness (alpha diversity) or in community composition (beta diversity), although the direction of change can be challenging to predict. For instance, introduced species may offset the loss of native specialist taxa, leading to no change in alpha diversity in urban areas, but decreased beta diversity (i.e., more homogenous community structure). Alternatively, because urban areas can have low connectivity and high environmental heterogeneity between sites, they may support distinct communities from one another over small geographic distances. 2) Wetlands and ponds provide critical ecosystem services and support diverse communities, making them important systems in which to understand consequences of urbanization. To determine how urban development shapes pond community structure, we surveyed 68 ponds around Madison, Wisconsin, USA, which were classified as urban, greenspace, or rural based on surrounding land use. We evaluated the influence of local abiotic factors, presence of nonnative fishes, and landscape characteristics on alpha diversity of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, and vertebrates. We also analyzed whether surrounding land cover was associated with changes in community composition and/or the presence of specific taxa. 3) We found a 23% decrease in mean richness (alpha diversity) from rural to urban pond sites, and a 15% decrease in richness from rural to urban greenspace pond sites. Among landscape factors, observed pond richness was negatively correlated with adjacent developed land and mowed lawns, as well as greater distances to other waterbodies. Among pond level factors, habitat complexity was associated with increased richness, while the presence of invasive fish was associated with decreased richness. 4) Beta diversity was relatively high for all ponds due to turnover in composition between sites. Urban ponds supported more introduced species, lacked a subset of native species found in rural ponds, and had slightly higher beta diversity than greenspace and rural ponds. 5) Synthesis and Applications: Integrating ponds into connected greenspaces comprised of native vegetation (rather than mowed grass), preventing nonnative fish introductions, and promoting habitat complexity may mitigate negative effects of urbanization on aquatic richness. The high beta diversity of distinct pond communities emphasizes their importance to biodiversity support in urban environments, despite being small in size and rarely incorporated into urban conservation planning.","ecology, geography, aquatic, human dominated, survey, community, ecosystem, habitat, species, animal, community, plant, biodiversity, conservation, landcover, landuse, freshwater, pond, wetland, urban, vegetation, invertebrate, vertebrate, vegetation, vascular plant, community dynamics, plant cover, species diversity, species richness, vegetation dynammics, fish, reptile, amphibian, grass"

Sampling on Lakes Monona, Wingra, and Fish started in 1995; sampling on other lakes started in 1981. Sampling is done at six littoral zone sites per lake with seine, minnow or crayfish traps, and fyke nets; a boat-mounted electrofishing system samples three littoral transects. Vertically hung gill nets are used to obtain two pelagic samples per lake from the deepest point. A trammel net samples across the thermocline at two sites per lake. In the bog lakes only fyke nets and minnow traps are deployed. Parameters measured include species-level identification and lengths for all fish caught, and scale samples and weight from a subset. Derived data sets include species richness, catch per unit effort, and size distribution by species, lake, and year. Dominant species vary from lake to lake. Perch, rockbass, and bluegill are common, with walleye, large and small mouth basses, northern pike and muskellunge as major piscivores.

Samples are collected as a composite whole-water sample and are preserved in gluteraldehyde. Composite sample depths are 0-8 meters for Lake Mendota (to conform to samples collected and analyzed since 1990 for a UW/DNR food web research study), and 0-2 meters for the other three lakes. A tube sampler is used for the 0-8 m Lake Mendota samples; samples for the other lakes are obtained by collecting water at 1-meter intervals using a Kemmerer water sampler and compositing the samples in a bucket. Samples are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling. Phytoplankton samples are analyzed by PhycoTech, Inc., a private lab specializing in phytoplankton analyses (see data protocol for procedures). Samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Permanent slide mounts (3 per sample) are prepared for all analyzed Mendota and Monona samples as well as 6 samples per year for Wingra and Fish; the slide mounts are archived at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Zoology Museum. Phytoplankton are identified to species using an inverted microscope (Utermohl technique) and are reported as natural unit (i.e., colonies, filaments, or single cells) densities per mL, cell densities per mL, and algal biovolume densities per mL. Multiple entries for the same species on the same date may be due to different variants or vegetative states - (e.g., colonial or attached vs. free cell.) Biovolumes for individual cells of each species are determined during the counting procedure by obtaining cell measurements needed to calculate volumes for geometric solids (e.g., cylinders, spheres, truncated cones) corresponding to actual cell shapes. Biovolume concentrations are then computed by mulitplying the average cell biovolume by the cell densities in the water sample. Note that one million cubicMicrometers of biovolume PerMilliliter of water are equal to a biovolume concentration of one cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter. Assuming a cell density equal to water, a cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter of biovolume converts to a biomass concentration of one milligramPerLiter.

Samples are        collected as a vertical tow using an 80-micron mesh conical net with a 30-cm diameter        opening (net mouth: net length ratio = 1:3) consistent with sampling conducted by the        Wisconsin Dept. Natural Resources in prior years. Zooplankton tows are taken in the deep        hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling;        zooplankton samples are preserved in 70% ethanol for later processing. Samples are usually        collected with standard tow depths on most dates (e.g., 20 meters for Lake Mendota) but not        always, so tow depth is recorded as a variate in the database. Crustacean species are        identified and counted for Mendota and Monona and body lengths are recorded for a portion of        each species identified (see data protocol for counting procedure); samples for Wingra and        Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted.

A total of 86 yellow perch from 25 lakes				were analyzed. Scales were used to determine age and length at ages 1 to 3 years. The				nitrogen stable isotope signature indicates the relative food-web position of the fish				relative to cladocerans collected from the same lake. The N_SIGNATURE value divided by 3.2				gives trophic position relative to cladoceran Sampling Frequency: one survey on each lake in				late June through late July of 1998 or 1999 Number of sites: 25 ","biogeochemistry, ecology, aquatic, ecosphere event, survey, community, animal, biological process, environmental process, isotope, nitrogen cycle, biodiversity, freshwater, lake, disturbance, food web, vertebrate, growth, disturbance, nitrogen, trophic dynamics, fish"
