"edi.1019","Invasive grass litter suppresses a native grass species and promotes disease","litter,competition,invasive species,disease","Plant litter can alter ecosystems and promote plant invasions by altering resource availability, depositing phytotoxins, and transmitting microorganisms to living plants. Transmission of microorganisms from invasive plant litter to live plants may gain importance as invasive plants, which often escape pathogens upon introduction to a new range, acquire new pathogens over time. It is unclear, however, if invasive plant litter affects native plant communities by promoting disease. Microstegium vimineum is an invasive grass that suppresses native populations, in part through litter production, and has acquired new fungal leaf spot diseases since its introduction to the United States. In a greenhouse experiment, we evaluated how M. vimineum litter and its pathogens mediated competition with the native grass Elymus virginicus. Microstegium vimineum litter promoted disease on E. virginicus and suppressed establishment and biomass of both species. Litter had stronger negative effects on E. virginicus than M. vimineum, increasing the relative biomass of M. vimineum. Live plant competition reduced biomass of both species and live M. vimineum increased disease incidence on E. virginicus. Altogether, invasive grass litter suppressed both species, ultimately favoring the invasive species in competition, and increased disease incidence on the native species."
"edi.1021","Macrosystems EDDIE Module 5: Introduction to Ecological Forecasting (Instructor Materials)","","Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions. When observations become available, they can assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated before the next forecast is generated.In this Macrosystems EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry & Exploration) module, students will apply the iterative forecasting cycle to develop an ecological forecast for a National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) site. Students will use NEON data to build an ecological model that predicts primary productivity. Using their calibrated model, they will learn about the different components of a forecast with uncertainty and compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites.The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about ecological forecasting and build a forecast for a NEON site. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate a forecast with uncertainty, and then compare the forecast with observations. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures.This EDI data package contains instructional materials and the files necessary to teach the module. Readers are referred to the Zenodo data package (Moore et al. 2022; DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6587161) for the R Shiny application code needed to run the module locally."
"edi.103","Habitat corridors alter relative trophic position of fire ants","SRS Corridor,connectivity,corridor,fire ant,fragmentation,patch shape,plant diversity,Solenopsis invicta,stable isotope analysis,trophic structure","
  Habitat fragmentation disrupts species movement, leading to local
  extinctions and altered community structure. Habitat corridors, which
  connect isolated patches of habitat and facilitate movement between
  patches, provide a potential solution to these negative impacts.
  However, most studies to date have examined the movement of species
  alone without considering emergent effects on the community (e.g.,
  altered trophic structure). We use large-scale, experimental
  landscapes and nitrogen stable isotopes ratios (delta-N-15) of a
  common generalist consumer (the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta) to
  determine how corridors affect trophic structure. Thus, because the
  fire ant is a species whose trophic position is flexible and whose
  diet typically reflects local prey availability, we assume that shifts
  in fire ants' trophic position between connected and isolated patches
  are likely to reflect shifts in patch trophic structure. We found that
  colonies in isolated patches had lower means and ranges of delta-N-15
  than colonies in otherwise similar connected patches, suggesting that
  corridors may increase fire ants' trophic position and breadth,
  respectively. Previous work in our landscapes documented higher
  species richness of plants in connected than unconnected patches.
  Patch means of ant delta-N-15 were positively correlated with plant
  richness, suggesting that increased plant richness may influence the
  observed responses in fire ant delta-N-15. Together these results
  suggest that fragmentation may reduce trophic position and narrow
  trophic breadth of dietary generalists such as the fire ant. These
  shifts likely reflect an alteration of food webs in isolated patches.
  Our results suggest that corridors may be effective in preventing or
  reducing such alterations.

  To investigate the possible role of landscape connectivity on the
  genetic structure of isolated populations, we examined the effects of
  habitat corridors on the population genetics of a vagile butterfly
  species, Junonia coenia, within a largescale, experimental system.
  Using allozyme electrophoresis, a total of nine loci were identified
  and scored, six of which exhibited polymorphism. Our data demonstrated
  consistently higher levels of expected (He) and observed (Ho)
  heterozygosity in butterflies sampled from patches connected by
  corridors compared to unconnected patches. A t-test comparing He and
  Ho in connected versus unconnected patches found a marginally
  significant difference in one locus, the glycolytic enzyme
  phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Connected patches exhibited overall
  lower FST values compared to unconnected patches, indicating
  potentially increased levels of gene flow due to corridors. Our
  results support previous investigations on dispersal and population
  size for J. coenia, and show that higher dispersal through corridors
  promotes genetic variability at a locus (PGI) implicated in dispersal
  and fitness in butterflies.

"edi.1149","Data for Avolio et al. Making sense of multivariate community responses in global change experiments","Centroids, data synthesis, dispersion, dissimilarity metrics, rank abundance curves, richness","Ecological communities are being impacted by global change worldwide. Experiments are a powerful tool to understand how global change will impact communities by comparing control and treatment replicates. Communities consist of multiple species and their associated abundances making multivariate methods a powerful approach to studying community compositional differences between control and treated replicates. Dissimilarity metrics are a commonly employed multivariate measure of compositional differences; however, while highly informative, dissimilarity metrics do not elucidate the specific ways in which communities differ. Integrating two multivariate methods, dissimilarity metrics and rank abundance curves has the potential to detect complex differences based on dissimilarity metrics and detail the how these differences came about through differences in richness, evenness, species ranks, or species identity. Here we use a database of 106 global change experiments located in herbaceous ecosystems and explore how patterns of ordinations based on dissimilarity metrics relate to rank abundance-curve based differences. We find that combining dissimilarity metrics alongside rank abundance curve-based measures clarify how global change treatments are altering communities. We find that when there is no difference in community composition (no distance between centroids of control and treated replicates), there are rarely differences in species ranks or species identities and more often differences in richness or evenness alone. In contrast, when there are differences between centroids of control and treated replicates, this is most often associated with differences in ranks either alone or co-occurring with differences in richness, evenness, or species identities. We suggest that integrating these two multivariate measures of community composition results in a deeper understanding of how global change impacts communities."

Patch-burn grazing (PBG) management is applied in temperate grazing lands to enhance environmental and economic sustainability; however, this management system has not been widely tested in subtropical humid grazing lands. The objective of this study was to determine how PBG affected forage resources, in comparison with the business-as usual full-burn (FB) management in both intensively managed pastures (IMP) and seminative (SN) pastures in subtropical humid grazing lands. We hypothesized that PBG management would create patch contrasts in forage quantity and nutritive value in both IMP and SN pastures, with a greater effect in SN pastures. A randomized block design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each), 8 each in IMP and SN at Archbold Biological Station’s Buck Island Ranch in Florida.
PBG management employed on IMP and SN resulted in creation of patch contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass metrics, and recent fire increased forage nutritive value. Residual standing biomass was significantly lower in burned patches of each year, creating heterogeneity within both pasture types under PBG. PBG increased digestible forage production in SN but not IMP pastures. These results suggest that PBG may be a useful management tool for enhancing forage nutritive value and creating patch contrast in both SN and IMP, but PBG does not necessarily increase production relative to FB management.
The annual increase in tissue quality and digestible forage production in a PBG system as opposed to once every 3 yr in an FB system is an important consideration for ranchers. Economic impacts of PBG and FB management in the two different pasture types are discussed, and we compare and contrast results from subtropical humid grazing lands with continental temperate grazing lands."

"edi.1295","The effect of salt dosing for chytrid mitigation on tadpoles of a threatened frog, Litoria aurea","chytrid,anuran,tadpole,hormesis,Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,salinity","The novel fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (chytrid) is one of the greatest threats to amphibians worldwide. Small increases in water salinity (up to ca. 4 ppt) have been shown to limit chytrid transmission between frogs, potentially providing a way to create environmental refugia to reduce its impact at a landscape scale. However, the effect of increasing water salinity on tadpoles, a life stage confined to water, is highly variable. Increased water salinity can lead to reduced size and altered growth patterns in some species, with flow-on effects to vital rates such as survival and reproduction. It is thus important to assess potential trade-offs caused by increasing salinity as a tool to mitigate chytrid in susceptible frogs.  We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of salinity on the survival and development of tadpoles of a threatened frog (Litoria aurea), previously demonstrated as a suitable candidate for trialling landscape manipulations to mitigate chytrid. We exposed tadpoles to salinity ranging from 1-6 ppt and measured survival, time to metamorphosis, body mass and locomotor performance of post-metamorphic frogs as a measure of fitness.  Survival and time to metamorphosis did not differ between salinity treatments or controls reared in rainwater. Body mass was positively associated with increasing salinity in the first 14 days. Juvenile frogs from three salinity treatments also showed the same or better locomotor performance compared to rainwater controls, confirming that environmental salinity may influence life history traits in the larval stage, potentially as a hormetic response. Our research suggests that salt concentrations in the range previously shown to improve survival of frogs in the presence of chytrid are unlikely to impact larval development of our candidate threatened species. Our study lends support to the idea of manipulating salinity to create environmental refugia from chytrid for at least some salt-tolerant species."

  There has been little comprehensive research undertaken to quantify

  Heteromyid populations co-vary with primary production whereas the
  cricetids can forage at multiple trophic levels reducing their
  dependence on primary productivity. Using isotopic values for Carbon,

        continually provide proof of their value, their Return on Investment (ROI) to their
        sponsors; yet doing so has always been difficult, problematic and not always successful.  In this work, an analysis of approaches for assessing the ROI of several scientific
        data repositories has identified various techniques that repositories use to report on the
        impact and value of their data products and services. A survey of selected repositories
        rated the set of metrics identified and rated each by its importance as well as the ease
        with which the metric could be measured. The discussion is broken down into considerations
        for calculating costs, perceived value of repositories and suggested metrics that would

  Bee populations are decreasing worldwide. The underlying causes are
  likely determined by factors at different scales. We tested the
  relative importance of local resources and landscape connectivity on
  64 bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) colonies in experimentally isolated
  and connected habitat fragments. We used colony mass, no. of workers,
  and no. of gynes to estimate colony performance. Landscape
  connectivity did not significantly affect colony performance, but
  local floral resources had a significantly positive effect, especially
  in isolated fragments. These results suggest that bumblebee colonies
  encountered sufficient floral resources within the local 1.4 ha
  habitat fragments to support colony growth, making long-distance
  foraging trips to neighboring fragments unnecessary. From a
  conservation perspective, we suggest that efforts to improve colony
  performance should prioritize boosting local floral resources over
  manipulation of large-scale landscape features.

        and root-to-shoot translocation was investigated using hydroponic experiments, microscopy,
        and spectroscopy. Uranium accumulated mainly in the roots (727-9376 mg kg-1) after 30 days
        of exposure to 80 µM dissolved U in water containing 1 mM HCO3 - at different Ca
        concentrations (0-6 mM) at pH 7.5. However, the concentration of U in the shoots increased
        22 times in experiments with 6 mM Ca compared to 0 mM Ca. In the Ca control experiment,
        transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses detected
        U-P-bearing precipitates in the cortical apoplast of parenchyma cells. In experiments with
        0.3 mM Ca, U-P-bearing precipitates were detected in the cortical apoplast and the bordered
        pits of xylem cells. In experiments with 6 mM Ca, U-P-bearing precipitates aggregated in the
        xylem with no apoplastic precipitation. These results indicate that Ca in carbonate water
        inhibits the transport and precipitation of U in the root cortical apoplast and facilitates
        the symplastic transport and translocation toward shoots. These findings reveal the
        considerable role of Ca in the presence of carbonate in facilitating the transport of U in
        plants and present new insights for future assessment and phytoremediation

These growth differences are often considered to be due to differences in belowground carbon (C) expenditure, or in cost efficiency, i.e. amount of nutrients acquired per C expended. In order to understand whether growth differences between M and NM plants are dictated by differences in C availability, we searched published reports on  for relations between plant growth and belowground C allocation, C use efficiency, or nutrient uptake, in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) versus non-mycorrhizal plants.

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Therefore, this dataset was created by combining the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments on the interaction between competition and predation. These experiments tested whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects. The combined data was then analyzed using a factorial meta-analysis technique, the results of which were published in the study titled The Interaction between Competition and Predation: A Meta-analysis of Field Experiments (Gurevitch et al., 2000).

"edi.541","Plant size and spatial pattern in a natural population of Myosotis micrantha","Plant biomass,competition,spatial variability","This dataset was created for examining the spatial distribution of plant size in a natural plant population, and for understanding the processes which govern the same. A winter annual species, Myosotis stricta (formally known as Myosotis micrantha), was chosen for this purpose. Data collection was carried on the campus of Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, USA) in May 1988, along a 700 cm x 20 cm transect. It was found that a size hierarchy existed in this plant population. Plants lacking immediate conspecific neighbors were larger than plants with one or more near neighbours, suggesting that competition from near neighbours depressed plant size.  However, there was a strong positive spatial autocorrelation in plant size: large plants were associated with large neighbours and small ones with small neighbors. Plant size was also positively correlated with the combined biomass of near neighbors. Thus, the population formed a two-phase mosaic of patches of relatively large plants alternating with patches of smaller plants. These results were published in the paper titled Plant size and spatial pattern in a natural population of Myosotis micrantha (Wilson and Gurevitch, 1995). "

It has been argued that native–exotic richness relationships (NERR) are negative at small spatial scales and positive at large scales, but evidence for the role of spatial scale on NERR has been contradictory. However, no formal quantitative synthesis had previously examined whether NERR is scale-dependent across multiple studies, and previous studies on NERR have not distinguished spatial grain and extent, which may drive very different ecological processes Therefore, a global systematic review was carried out to create this dataset, which includes 204 individual cases of observational (non-experimental) NERRs from 101 publications. Further, the above-mentioned hypotheses were investigated using a hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis, which showed that NERR was indeed highly scale dependent across studies and increased with the log of grain size. Also, no clear patterns of NERR across different spatial extents were found, suggesting that extent plays a less important role in determining NERR than does grain, although there was a complex interaction between extent and grain size. Almost all studies on NERR were found to have been conducted in North America, western Europe, and a few other regions, with little information on tropical or Arctic regions. NERR was also found to increase northward in temperate regions and vary with longitude. These results were published in the paper titled Correlation of native and exotic species richness: a global meta-analysis finds no invasion paradox across scales (Peng et al. 2018), which represents the first global quantitative analysis of scale-based NERR.

The paper describes an approach for harmonizing and reformatting community survey data such as organism abundance or cover measurements. Data currently using this data model and workflow approach are from the repository of the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Data were assembled for this analysis in late 2020. The inventory is composed of two tables, describing data from EDI (including LTER) and data from NEON. The EDI inventory includes information for 70 datasets: identifiers for both the original and converted datasets, and basic coverage information such as temporal coverage (range of years and a measurement of sampling evenness), spatial coverage (maximum bounding coordinates and area of the ""bounding box""), and taxonomic coverage (taxonomic classes). The NEON inventory contains information from 11 continent-wide NEON data products, divided into individual field sites to be more spatially compatible with EDI and LTER data. Taxonomic coverage is by group (e.g., algae, birds) rather than explicit taxonomic classes. Spatial coverage is the area of a field sampling site polygon. Temporal coverage includes the same minimum and maximum sampling years and temporal evenness measures as for the EDI data plus a count of months during that period when sampling occurred.

The study had two primary goals: (1) analyze the state of near-term ecological forecasting literature, and (2) compare forecast skill across ecosystems and variables. We began by conducting a Web of Science search for “forecast*” in the title, abstract, and keywords of all papers published in ecological journals, then screened all papers from this search to identify near-term ecological forecasts. We defined a near-term ecological forecast as future predictions of community, population, or biogeochemical variables = 10 years from the forecast date.  To more broadly survey the literature, we then searched all papers that cited or were cited by the near-term ecological forecasts we identified. We performed an in-depth review of all near-term ecological forecasting papers identified through this search process, and recorded forecast skill data for all papers that reported R or R2. Our results indicate that the rate of publication of near-term ecological forecasts is increasing over time and the field is becoming increasingly open and automated. Across published forecasts, we find that forecast skill decreases in predictable patterns and these patterns differ between forecast variables. This data publication includes three products from this analysis: (1) a database of all papers identified in the two searches, including our assessment of whether they included an ecological focal variable, included a forecast, and whether the forecast was near-term (=10 years), (2) a matrix of all data collected on the near-term ecological forecasts we identified, and (3) a database of R2 values for papers that reported R or R2.

We explored how those trait features compare between ancestral and non-native populations of the globally distributed weed Centaurea solstitialis.  MethodsWe measured traits related to survival, size, reproduction, and dispersal in field sampling following major environmental gradients; that of elevation in Anatolia (ancestral range) and that of precipitation in Argentina (non-native range).  We also estimated abundance.Key resultsWe found that overall variation in traits in ancestral populations was similar to that in non-native populations.  Only one trait, seed mass, displayed greater variation in ancestral than non-native populations; coincidentally, seed mass has been shown to track global range expansion of C. solstitialis.  Traits displayed several associations, among which seed mass and number were positively related in both ranges.  Many traits varied with elevation in the ancestral range, whereas none varied with precipitation in the non-native one.  Interestingly, most traits varying with elevation within the ancestral range also displayed differences in attributes between ancestral and non-native ranges.  Unexpectedly, ancestral plants were more fecund than non-native plants, but density was greater in the non-native than ancestral range, indicating that C. solstitialis survives at larger proportions in the non-native than ancestral range.ConclusionsOur results suggest that maintaining levels of trait variation in non-native populations comparable to those in ancestral populations, avoiding trait trade-offs, and developing differences in trait attributes between ranges can play a major role in the success of many weeds in novel environments."

          Crime data assembled by census block group for the MSA from the Applied Geographic Solutions' (AGS) 1999 and 2005 'CrimeRisk' databases distributed by the Tetrad Computer Applications Inc.   CrimeRisk is the result of an extensive analysis of  FBI crime statistics. Based on detailed modeling of the relationships between crime and demographics, CrimeRisk provides an accurate view of the relative risk of specific crime types at the block group level.  Data from 1990 - 1996,1999, and 2004-2005 were used to compute the attributes, please refer to the 'Supplemental Information' section of the metadata for more details.  Attributes are available for two categories of crimes, personal crimes and property crimes, along with total and personal crime indices.  Attributes for personal crimes include murder, rape, robbery, and assault.  Attributes for property crimes include burglary, larceny, and mother vehicle theft.  12 block groups have no attribute information.  CrimeRisk is a block group and higher level geographic database consisting of a series of standardized indexes for a range of serious crimes against both persons and property. It is derived from an extensive analysis of several years of crime reports from the vast majority of law enforcement jurisdictions nationwide. The crimes included in the database are the ""Part I"" crimes and include murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft. These categories are the primary reporting categories used by the FBI in its Uniform Crime Report (UCR), with the exception of Arson, for which data is very inconsistently reported at the jurisdictional level. Part II crimes are not reported in the detail databases and are generally available only for selected areas or at high levels of geography.  In accordance with the reporting procedures using in the UCR reports, aggregate indexes have been prepared for personal and property crimes separately, as well as a total index. While this provides a useful measure of the relative ""overall"" crime rate in an area, it must be recognized that these are unweighted indexes, in that a murder is weighted no more heavily than a purse snatching in the computation. For this reason, caution is advised when using any of the aggregate index values.  The block group boundaries used in the dataset come from TeleAtlas's (formerly GDT) Dynamap data, and are consistent with all other block group boundaries in the BES geodatabase.

          For use in the environmental injustices study of Baltimore relating to patterns of environmental disamenties in relation to low income/minority communities.
          Description
          This feature class layer is a point dataset of appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) from 1938 to 1999 concerning identified environmental disamentities.  The data was gathered from records from the Zoning Board of Appeals decisions since 1931 relating to environmental disamentities and to be used to examine environmental injustices involving low income/minority communities in Baltimore. To see if environmental injustices exist in Baltimore, this point layer will be overlayed with race/income data to determine if patterns of inequity exist.  Points were placed manually using the associated addresses from the ZBA_master dataset.  The ID number associated with each point is related to its appeal number from the Zoning Board of Appeals.  Multiple points on the data layer have the same ZBA_ID number, making it a one-to-many relationship.  This layer can be joined with the ZBA_master table using the ""ZBA_point_relationship"" and the field ""ZBA_ID"".

          Description
          Assessments & Taxation (A&T) Database from MD Property View 2004 for Anne Arundel County.  The A&T Database contains parcel data from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation; it incorporates parcel ownership and address information, parcel valuation information and basic information about the land and structure(s) associated with a given parcel. These data form the basis for the 2004 Database, which also includes selected Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) characteristics, text descriptions to make parcel code field data more readily accessible and logical True/False fields which identify parcels with certain characteristics.  Documentation for A&T, including a thorough definition for all attributes is enclosed.  Complete Property View documentation can be found at http://www.mdp.state.md.us/data/index.htm under the ""Technical Background"" tab.
          It should be noted that the A&T Database consists of points and not parcel boundaries.  For those areas where parcel polygon data exists the A&T Database  can be joined using the ACCTID or a concatenation of the BLOCK and LOT fields, whichever is appropriate.  (Spaces may have to be excluded when concatenating the BLOCK and LOT fields).
          A cursory review of the 2004 version of the A&T Database indicates that it has more accurate data when compared with the 2003 version, particularly with respect to dwelling types.  However, for a given record it is not uncommon for numerous fields to be missing attributes.  Based on previous version of the A&T Database it is also not unlikely that some of the information is inaccurate.  This layer was edited to remove points that did not have a valid location because they failed to geocode.  There were 897 such points.  A listing of the deleted points is in the table with the suffix ""DeletedRecords.""

          Description
          Assessments & Taxation (A&T) Database from MD Property View 2004 for Carroll County.  The A&T Database contains parcel data from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation; it incorporates parcel ownership and address information, parcel valuation information and basic information about the land and structure(s) associated with a given parcel. These data form the basis for the 2004 Database, which also includes selected Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) characteristics, text descriptions to make parcel code field data more readily accessible and logical True/False fields which identify parcels with certain characteristics.  Documentation for A&T, including a thorough definition for all attributes is enclosed.  Complete Property View documentation can be found at http://www.mdp.state.md.us/data/index.htm under the ""Technical Background"" tab.
          It should be noted that the A&T Database consists of points and not parcel boundaries.  For those areas where parcel polygon data exists the A&T Database  can be joined using the ACCTID or a concatenation of the BLOCK and LOT fields, whichever is appropriate.  (Spaces may have to be excluded when concatenating the BLOCK and LOT fields).
          A cursory review of the 2004 version of the A&T Database indicates that it has more accurate data when compared with the 2003 version, particularly with respect to dwelling types.  However, for a given record it is not uncommon for numerous fields to be missing attributes.  Based on previous version of the A&T Database it is also not unlikely that some of the information is inaccurate.  This layer was edited to remove points that did not have a valid location because they failed to geocode.  There were 848 such points.  A listing of the deleted points is in the table with the suffix ""DeletedRecords.""

Also included are ground cover photos of plots along the biomass transect used to create the projected biomass data.  
We calculated the percent cover of vegetation for the biomass and intensively monitored transects from digital photographs. Photographs were rectified to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels and a 20 x 20 grid was applied to the photograph. The percentage of each plant type was estimated in each grid cell. The percent cover was regressed against the measured dry biomass to project biomass for the intensively measured transect. We did not project moss biomass and instead assumed it to be the same for both transects. 
We projected the change in biomass over the growing season from the change in greenness determined from digital photographs. We chose five dates throughout the growing season with pictures of equal color saturation, focus and aspect. From these we estimated the percent photosynthetic biomass by selecting areas of green on the photograph and calculating the percentage of the total pixels made up by these areas. We estimated curves for the change in % green vegetation for 0, 6 m and the mean of the remaining distances along the transect (12, 18, 24, and 30 m), as these regions of the transect exhibited different patterns of greenness across the growing season of 2004. To estimate photosynthetic biomass over the growing season, we corrected the biomass estimates for the study transect to account for the change in green vegetation associated with growth and senescence

At the beginning of the 2003 growing season, we installed several meteorological instruments. We measured temperatures using copper-constantan theromocouples (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT, USA) at 5, 10 20, and 50 cm depth on the east and west side of the boardwalk at 0, 10 (west side only) 20, and 30 m distance along the transect.

To measure rain, we installed a TE 525MM tipping bucket rain gauge (Texas Electronics Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) at 2m on the tower. To measure water level, we installed a Druck21 PDCR 1830-8388 submersible pressure transducer (5 psi range, Druck Inc., New Fairfield, CT, USA) inserted 60 cm below the soil surface, down an 11 cm interior diameter PVC well at 30m along the transect. We measured photosynthetically active radiation with Apogee quantum sensors (Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 30, 60, 120, and 240 cm above the soil surface. To monitor changes in thaw depth, we probed the soil at each visit (every one to two weeks throughout the growing season), every 3 m along both the east and west sides of the transect.

Thirty-five cores were collected soil cores along the transect in March 2003. We drilled cores using a gasoline powered, permafrost corer while soils were frozen. Two to four cores were drilled every 3 m along the transect, yielding a total of 35 cores. We stored cores frozen and cut sample sections using a radial saw. Cores were sampled at the interfaces between different soil layers. We classified soils using the Canadian Soil Classification system (Soil Classification Working Group 1998) identifying fibric, mesic, and humic organic horizions and the A and C mineral horizons. Nine cores were sampled only to the mineral boundary. We measured bulk density, %C and %N for all soil samples. The pH of sample was determined using litmus paper.  We oven-dried at 50 - 65 degC and ground all samples before analysis. We analyzed samples for %C and %N using a Carlo Erba EA1108 CHNS analyzer (CE Instruments, Milan, Italy) and a COSTECH ECS 4010 CHNS-O analyzer (Costech Analytical Technologies Inc., Valencia, CA,USA). Sample standard errors were +/- 0.01% for nitrogen, +/- 0.45% for carbon.  To indicate fire events in the surrounding ecosystem, charcoal layers in the cores were quantified.  We estimated charcoal by emptying dried samples of a known volume and depth (on mean 4.5 cm3) over a 10 cm x 10 cm grid and counting macroscopic charcoal fragments (greater than 0.05 mm in diameter) in each cm grid cell."

"knb-lter-bnz.229","Black spruce needle nitrogen concentration from 5 stands in 1999","black spruce,Fairbanks,nitrogen","We collected black spruce needle from several sites located near Fairbanks Ak, and Delta, Ak in August 1999 (Sites designated here as S1, S2, and S3) were located in Fairbanks (64o40?N, 148o15?W), Alaska (S1: 64o52.164? N, 147o51.462? W; S2: 64o52.058? N, 147o51.378? W; S3: 64o51.603? N, 147o52.789? W) with 2 additional sites (S4, S5) in Delta, Alaska (64010? N, 145030? W).  In each stand, 30 trees were randomly selected for sampling. Within each tree, five shoots were collected from the southern aspect of the mid-canopy height from each of the following age classes: 0-, 1-, 4-, 9-, and 19-years old. In two of the Fairbanks stands (S2, S3), 19-year old needles were not present. A total of 690 samples over the five stands include 150 samples per stand in three stands (S1, S4, S5) and 120 samples per stand in the other two stands (S2, S3). Needles were returned to the lab and nitrogen content was determined.  We used a three-factor nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate differences in needle N concentration among the ages of needles on a tree, among trees nested within a stand, and among stands. Ages and stands were treated as fixed factors and tree was treated as a random factor. The ANOVA and means testing for these differences used Proc GLM in the SAS statistical package with needle N content as the dependent variable and needle age, tree, and stand as independent variables. The GLM procedure handled the problem of missing treatment combinations within the ANOVA. Type III sum of squares was used to test the effects of factors without interactions

"knb-lter-bnz.300","Greenup values for interior alaska 1976 - Present","plant phenology,greenup,bud burst","Greenup, the frequent rapid transformation of Interior Alaska from Brown space to spring green as the leaves deciduous trees burst forth, is suddenly enough to allow assignment of a single date in a given area to this culmination of a key biological process.  Greenup is important for more than just an aesthetic or biological perspective.  For example, once Greenup has occurred, there is a rapid increase in evapotranspiration.  Which in turn has important consequences in the areas mesoscale meteorology.

Here, dates for green around Fairbanks for more than 20 springs are correlated against several different temperature derived indices calculated entirely from routinely available climatological data.  We examined a variety of degree day statistics and temperature thresholds.  The relationships between these parameters and Greenup dates in Interior Alaska should be useful in projecting future greenup dates.  They may also be useful to post analyze Greenup dates in years for which there is meteorological data but no surviving record of Greenup dates.

Respiration collars (18) were randomly located on three 20 x 20 m sampling grids (separate from WSOC collection) at each site. The respiration collars (10.2 cm diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride) were inserted to a depth of 2.5 cm at least 1 week prior to initial measurements and were left in place for the duration of the experiment. Care was taken to ensure that the collars remained at the same depth throughout the measurement period. All vascular plants were removed from the collars prior to measuring. Measurements were made approximately bi-weekly at each site, from May through September in 2004 (n = 5 or 6). A portable thermometer was used to measure soil temperature at 10 cm below the surface concurrently with soil respiration measured at each collar. Changes in collar-specific air volumes (caused by changes in microtopography and the presence of moss) were measured directly through use of the ideal gas law by injecting 25 cm-3 of 3500 mg m-3 CO2 into the soil respiration chamber and measuring the subsequent dilution of CO2 concentration with the IRGA. All flux values have been adjusted for these collar specific volumes."
"knb-lter-bnz.578","Relationship of Community Characteristics to Harvest Reporting: Comparative study of household surveys and harvest tickets in Alaska","moose,hunting,subsistence,harvests","Accurate harvest reporting is critical for wildlife management. Rural Alaskan communities reported a median of 42% of moose harvested via traditional harvest tickets compared to those reported in household surveys. This harvest-report ratio did not change over time. Twice as many moose were reported harvested during subsistence household surveys (n = 8,039) than on hunter harvest tickets (n = 3,557). Percentage of the community that was indigenous, used and shared moose, and absence of a wildlife biologist or road access were associated with low harvest-report ratios. Analysis revealed that household surveys provide important information about moose harvest rates and their use should be expanded. Reporting rates might be improved by building trust through respectful dialogue between hunters and managers and by placing more emphasis on the benefits of reporting harvests and less emphasis on enforcement."

Because litter chemistry changes throughout decomposition, we would expect the decomposer food web to interact with these changes in their basal resource to alter the trajectories of chemical changes during decay. To investigate how decomposer mesofauna influence patterns of litter chemical change throughout early stages of decay, we tracked mass loss, macro- and micronutrient elements, and fiber chemistry dynamics in Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii) leaves decomposed under optimal decay conditions in a biotically diverse compost pile. By using litterbags of two different mesh sizes to manipulate the mesofauna gaining access to the litter, we record how the complexity of the soil mesofauna community changes the trajectory of litter chemistry."

The size distribution of total chlorophyll a is determined by filtering water though filters of differing pore sizes.  These are then extracted in acetone and analyzed fluorometrically with Turner Designs 10-AU Fluorometer on CalCOFI cruises (since 2006, ongoing).  Chlorophyll a and taxon-specific pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) are qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the lab onshore by several size fractions (< 1µm to > 20µm) utilizing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis.  The samples analyzed within the CCE region are used to develop a metric for phytoplankton community structure that can be used to monitor its state and changes thereof over time."

Concentrations of bSiO2 varied by 25-fold across the front, with concentrations in frontal waters 20–25% of those in coastal waters.  Rates of biogenic silica production spanned an equally large range, with rates within the frontal region that were half those in the coastal regions.  The results suggest that the regions of frontal interactions between eddies in the southern CCE can account for variability in diatom biomass, productivity and export over very short spatial scales that is comparable to the variability observed across the Pacific basin."

From 1982-2004 a fence containing all of e001 plots in Field C was designed to exclude deer and all small mammals, including mice, voles and pocket gophers. This fence was removed in Fall of 2004 and individual plots designated for e172 were enclosed in deer fences. 

The purpose of E001 was to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time would affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals.  There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients.  The plots are in a 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots.  Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June."

The study attempts to develop an efficient trapping system for the detection and monitoring of exotic bark and wood boring beetles, particularly longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae). It was conducted from 12 May 2003 to 30 July 2003 in mature white pine stand with lots of tree mortality to southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis. There were four replicates of eight treatments set in RBD with four replicates at each of two sites. Treatments involved funnel traps baited with combinations of three common bark beetle pheromones: lanierone, ipsenol and ipsdienol. The objective is to use areas in the south with substantial populations of native beetles to develop a generic trap for large wood borers before attempting trials in areas such as China and Russia. Several types of intercept traps will be tested with various host compounds such as ethanol and alpha-pinene."

Two emerging hypotheses that account for coexistence in ant communities are the discovery-dominance tradeoff and the dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoff. Here we used behavioural assays and community-level sampling from ant assemblages in the southern Appalachians, USA to test for the discovery-dominance and dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoffs.

In April 2012, radiation shields constructed of two inverted plastic funnels were added to a subset of loggers in an attempt to reduce the effect of solar radiation on daytime temperature observations.  Light intensity data collected by the loggers were used as a means of flagging potentially erroneous observations when the logger was exposed to direct sunlight.  A light intensity threshold above which observations were flagged was determined by comparing logger observations to those collected by nearby (<5m) sensors protected with commercial gill style radiation shields.  Despite attempts to flag potentially erroneous daytime temperature observations, it is likely that errors remain and these data should be used accordingly."

As most vascular plants in the Southern Appalachians rely on ants for seed dispersal, this significant predation on ants, especially Aphaenogaster, reveals an intriguing and important relationship between these salamanders and the vascular plant abundance and distribution within their ecosystem. Additionally, consumption of ants increases with high temperatures and low relative humidity indicating that, with climate change, the effects of Plethodon foraging behavior on woodland biodiversity will be amplified. Using a paired design, we placed removal plots along an elevational gradient within the plethodon shermani-teyahalee hybrid zone at the Coweeta LTER to observe and quantify the effect of Plethodon foraging on ant communities, seed dispersal, and vascular plant distribution by removing the salamanders from treatment plots. Foraging rates of ants, with a focus on Aphaenogaster, were monitored at treatment and control plots using direct observation/counts of ants visiting tuna bait stations."

When data on organic matter content wasn’t available but qualitative descriptions of soil type were, the type unit of soil was classified as either organic or mineral based on the descriptive lithology. When lithologic descriptions were provided and indicated the soil profile was not entirely one soil type (e.g. peat), depth of peat within core was recorded. When data source had specific coordinates, those coordinates were used. For older studies that only provided a figure showing the location of each estimate at a broad scale, location was estimated by georeferencing the figure in ArcMap, and dropping a point at each location. Records were cross-referenced with a recent vegetation map developed by the National Park Service in order to obtained vegetation community at each location (Ruiz et al. 2017)."

A comprehensive search was performed to find the original sources of dates reported for all archaeological sites in this area. As such, dates reported from any time (i.e., 1960s to the present) were incorporated, which includes dates with problems. Data were compiled by John Turck and numerous undergraduate work study and volunteer students over a large period of time (from January 2012 to July 2012, and from January 2013 to April 2013). John Turck added to and refined the dataset between May 2013 and February 2014. In general, the database was structured so the information could be easily input into CALIB's online calibration program. It includes information such as: sample IDs, raw age and standard deviation, delta 13 correction factor, adjusted age and standard deviation, site number and name, material, association, and references. Calibrated dates were not entered into this databse. These data can be used to aid in archaeological studies, refining our understanding of the timing of human occupations throughout the coastal plain, and especially in the coastal zone. These data can also be used to aid geological, and geomorphological studies. The nature of the data is such that it will need to be continually added to as new samples are processesd, and further refined as more information about dates entered previosuly are obtained.  Note: The original radiocarbon date database contains sensitive information (i.e., the specific location of archaeological sites) that is for professional archaeologists only.

    Rarámuri Criollo cows have behavioral traits that are desirable for
    rangelands in arid environments, but calves from this biotype are
    difficult to market through conventional methods. One strategy to
    improve marketability is to crossbreed these cows with traditional
    beef breed bulls. However, it is unclear whether crossbred calves
    will achieve marketable weights and carcass qualities on rangeland
    and whether they will retain the desirable grazing behaviors of
    their mothers. We evaluated these traits for two cohorts of Rarámuri
    Criollo (JRC), Mexican Criollo (MC), and Criollo × beef-breed
    crossbred (XC) steers. Final live and carcass weights of XC were
    greater than JRC and MC, but all three groups were market ready at
    30-mo after finishing on grass. Carcass quality and average daily
    gain did not differ among biotypes. Both JRC and XC steers exhibited
    grazing patterns similar to those previously observed in JRC cows.
    These results suggest JRC, MC, and XC steers can achieve desirable
    slaughter weights in 30 months using a rangeland-based grass-fed
    protocol, and JRC and XC steers retain desirable grazing behaviors
    of JRC cows.

    This data package contains vegetative cover data of plots that have

    removed at the Jornada Basin LTER site in southern New Mexico, USA.
    This data was collected in an effort to distinguish the differential
    effects of plant community biomass, plant community functional
    groups, and biodiversity within functional groups on plant community
    function. To make these distinctions, treatments were established by
    the selective removal of plant species or functional groups within
    experimental plots. There are eight treatments: control (C, no
    removals); four functional group removal treatments (PG, perennial
    grass removed; S, shrubs removed; SSh, subshrubs removed; Succ,
    succulents removed), and three species richness manipulation
    treatments. Richness manipulations included a simplified treatment
    (Simp), where only the single most abundant species of each growth
    form is preserved and all other species in the growth form are
    removed, a reduced-Larrea treatment (rL), where the Larrea is
    assumed to be the dominant and is removed while minority components
    remain, and a reduced-Prosopsis treatment (rP), where Prosopis
    rather than Larrea is removed as the shrub dominant. Following
    treatments, vegetative data was collected by sampling each plot
    along three transects twice a year (Spring and Fall) for 5 years
    from 1997-2002 (no data collected in 1998). This data set consists
    of the date of collection, plot number, treatment type, transect

          The objectives of this project are to quantify the seasonably variable timing among meteoric precipitation, groundwater recharge, and groundwater temperature. Hypotheses are: 1. Because of the karst-like characteristics of the aquifers in N04d (and by extension, the entire region), recharge will be rapid during moderately large precipitation events where fractures are enlarged by dissolution and therefore highly conductive, except during the most active part of the growing season. 2. The recharge efficiency of the aquifers will be spatially variable, with highest hydraulic conductivity (because of solution enlargement of fractures) near the riparian zone. 3. Groundwater temperature will vary continuously over the year and also demonstrate abrupt changes after recharge-effective precipitation events when the precipitation temperature is different from the groundwater temperature. Because the aquifers are merokarst and recharge is rapid, data are recorded at high frequency (5 minute intervals).

There was previously very limited documentation on macrobasidiomycete diversity for these islands, although recent studies had shown that at least 15% of the species were undescribed. This project complemented previous and ongoing surveys in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela. The information gained from this project will ultimately help us to understand differences in colonization and rates of speciation among different groups of basidiomycetes in island chains. The investigators in this project discovered at least 75 new species and varieties so far, as well as several new genera (Pegler et al. 1998; Samuels &amp; Lodge 1996) and one possible new family or order (see 'Aliens' under GENUS).

After separating more than 50 individual soil apatite grains from each sample, we used scanning electron microscopy to quantify the morphology and surface etching of apatite grains to determine the degree of weathering. We developed three metrics to quantify the degree of weathering: aspect ratio, percent crystal faces, and a qualitative pitting index. This dataset contains the raw data from analyzing the morphology of more than 600 grains using the software ImageJ. Samples were collected during January 2013.

Spectral data in the red and near infra- red bands were recorded at sixty plots (points) in four rows located approximately at 10, 25, 45, and 75 meters east of the fence (the drift area). The plots were marked with thin wire stakes put into the ground and flagged (for visibility) and given aluminum tags with their plot identification code. All the plots were located in Kobresia myosuroides communities. In each row there were ten plots located in control areas just to the north and south of the area affected by the snowfence -- five to the north and five to the south -- and five plots located in the drift area of the snowfence. The individual plots were broken into groups of five according to their location (i.e., their distance from the fence (row), and location within their row (north, south, or within the snowfence area)). Within each of these groups, the plots were given a number starting with one and going to five. The plots were then given unique codes made up of plot type (c for control and sf for snowfence), location within a row (for the control plots only - n for north and s for south), the distance in meters of the row from the snowfence (10, 25, 45, or 75), and the number that uniquely identifies each plot within a group (one through five). For example, the code cn10_1 represents plot number one of the group of control plots north of the snowfence and 10 meters east of the snowfence. The location of each plot was measured as set of coordinates within the snowfence area. The southern terminus of the snowfence was used as the origin, with the y-axis running along the snowfence and the x-axis running perpendicular to the snowfence at it's southern end. The first coordinate was the distance in m from the y-axis in an easterly direction, and the second coordinate was the distance in m from the x-axis in a northly direction. Note that the 10, 25, and 45 meter rows are actually at roughly 15, 30, and 50 meters east of the snowfence whereas the 75 meter row is actually at 75 m. east of the snowfence. It is also important to note that the plots are not necessarily in numerical order in each row, and that the x and y locations were only approximately measured."

  Small mammals were live trapped during the summer of each year at
  various locations on Niwot Ridge. Species trapped included pikas
  (Ochotona princeps), marmots (Marmota flaviventris), deer mice
  (Peromyscus maniculatus), voles (Microtus longicaudus, Microtus
  montanus, and Phenacomys intermedius), and pocket gophers (Thomomys
  talpoides). Pocket gophers were only trapped through the summer of
  1983. Mice and voles were trapped using Sherman traps, while Tomahawk
  traps were used to trap both the pikas and marmots. Sherman gopher
  traps were used to trap gophers. The mice and vole traps were placed
  10 meters apart in parallel rows in grids containing from 25 to 100
  traps. Weather permitting, the traps were placed for 3 consecutive
  nights every 1 or 2 weeks from June to August. The pikas, marmots, and
  gophers were trapped during a 10-day census period beginning around 15
  August of each year. The traps were selectively placed in areas where
  evidence of the animals existed. In the case of the pocket gophers,
  the traps were placed below ground in active mounds. The traps were
  set during the day, and traplines were run every 2 hours. Consult the
  appropriate figures in Halfpenny et al. (1984; 1987) for these trap
  locations, as well as descriptions of baiting and handling techniques
  and surrounding vegetation communities. After determining and
  recording the species, gender, age, reproductive status, weight,
  health, and trap location, the animals were permanently tagged and
  released.

  An additional quality-controlled derived data-table
  (smammals_no_recap.cr.data.csv) was added to the original dataset in
  2022. This data table is derived from the original capture data, but
  includes only year-unique captures, where each year-unique capture is
  the ""best"" one for comparison with other year-unique
  captures. For comparability among years, the “best” capture for
  comparability among years is usually the first capture of the year,
  representing the animal's baseline weight for the year (weight appears
  to drop rapidly with repeated captures, probably due to
  capture-induced stress; this weight-loss is most evident in adults,
  because they're no longer growing, but may also affects juvies by
  retarding their normal weight gain). These derived data were prepared
  by Chris Ray using several lines of evidence to make these
  determinations. In some cases determinations were complicated by
  eartag loss, etc., and best judgement was used in all cases reviewing
  every data entry and make a determination

  The lysimeter array is a collection of 105 snowmelt lysimeters that
  collect discharge measurements at the base of the snowpack. Each
  lysimeter is a polyethylene pan with 22 cm high vertical walls and 47
  cm by 39.5 cm in horizontal extent resulting in a footprint area of
  ~1,850 cm2. The height of the lysimeter walls prevent both the loss of
  water out of the lysimeters and the influx of water from saturated
  zones along the snow-soil interface [Kattelmann, 2000]. This location
  collected data during spring snowmelt (April through July) for water
  years 1998 through 2003. From 1998 through 2001, the array was
  organized as a two meter grid nested within a four meter grid. The
  1998 water year had only 36 lysimeters installed. In the 2002 water
  year, 15 of lysimeters on the perimeter were relocated to increase the
  density of the inner grid. Lysimeters were moved from locations of low
  snow accumulation on the eastern edge and a region that collects
  debris during melt on the western edge. Meltwater collected by the
  lysimeters flowed to an underground laboratory through flexible PVC
  piping into Rainwise Rainew Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges. The cumulative
  number of tips were recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR1O data logger
  at one hour intervals summed to daily totals for this dataset. The
  precision of outflow is approximately 11 ml (~0.06 mm given the
  footprint of the lysimeter). This dataset includes the coordinates for

The more than 700 Landsat scenes have been resampled to a 1-arc-second (approximately 30-meter) sample interval in a geographic coordinate system using the North American Horizontal Datum of 1983.  Three  bands have been selected from the eight spectral bands available for each frame.  These are bands 4 (near-infrared), 3 (red), and 2 (green), typically displayed as red, green, and blue, respectively.  The image is a full-resolution (spectral and spatial), 24-bit color-infrared composite that simulates color infrared film as a ""false color composite"".

Parameters measured were temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, precipitation, barometric pressure, and wind speed. The station was initially instrumented with a thermohygrograph (regularly calibrated and checked with maximum and minimum thermometers and psychrometers), which was equipped with a Bourdon tube (to measure temperature) and a banjo-spread hair element (to measure relative humidity). The thermohygrograph was situated in a white, all wood, louvered Stevenson screen which is oriented with the door facing north. The station was initially instrumented with a standard 8-inch precipitation gauge installed with the rim 1 m above ground. This gauge was not shielded prior to October 1964. A recording precipitation gauge was installed in 1965. An Alter shield and snow fence were placed around the gauge to give more accurate precipitation measurements during windy conditions. Precipitation was caught in a bucket containing ethylene glycol (to melt snow) and light oil (to prevent evaporation). As the weight of the bucket increased, a pen moved up via a spring mechanism and recorded on a rotating chart. Solar radiation was recorded on a bimetalic strip mechanical actinometer. Ninety percent of solar radiation from 360 to 2000 nm was transmitted through the instrument's glass dome. The station was initially instrumented with a totalizing anemometer (2 m height). Wind speed (peak gust) was subsequently measured with a 3-cup, AC-generating anemometer that continuously recorded onto an Esterline Angus strip chart recorder. Wind direction was recorded as a pen position on a continuously recording strip chart. The thermohygrograph, rain gauge, and actinometer all used wind-up or battery-driven clock drives that rotated the recording chart on a right cylindrical drum with a fixed period between 24 h and 861 h depending on the gears used.

The system used consisted of a Tektronics 1502B reflectometer, a Tektronics SP232 interface module, a Compaq LTE/232 PC, coaxial cable, and a probe that was left semi-permanently in the soil. The reflectometer generated an electrical step voltage pulse which was propagated down the cable to the probe. The reflected voltage waveform was measured, stored, and displayed by the reflectometer and the Tektronics SP232 interface module. The waveform is represented as a 2-dimensional data array, with the x-axis representing time (which is converted to distance using the dielectric constant of the cable) and the y-axis representing voltage for the given time: in this system this value is represented in millirho units (Tektronics 1991). The length of the waveform is determined by measuring the difference between the soil air interface (SAI) and the end of the voltage step reflection (RE). The SAI value is equivalent to the apex of the first peak in the wave and the RE value is equivalent to the intersection of tangents ""drawn"" at (a) the bottom of the wave and (b) the point of the steepest rise (see Taylor and Seastedt 1992). The waveform length is then used to estimate the volumetric and gravimetric moisture of the surrounding soil."

Each plot was located within 2 m of the stake, but always in the same vegetation type as that associated with the stake. The distance and direction from the grid stake were randomly selected, and thus varied from plot to plot. Point quadrat measurements have been made at irregular intervals from 1989 to the present (1989, 1990, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2008,  and yearly from 2010 onward). The point-quadrat technique used was identical to that described by Auerbach (1992) for sampling in 1989 to 1997: The point-quadrat method was used for estimating plant cover. The aluminum point-quadrat frame was 1 m^2 in size, with double-layer filament spaced 10 cm apart to make a 10 x 10 cm grid, for a total of 100 sample points per plot. Before sampling, the point-quadrat frame was leveled and plots were permanently marked in the following manner. Aluminum tags were nailed into the ground so that a frame could be repositioned in the same location from year to year; i.e., tags with a hole in the middle were used to define the locations for the point frame legs and four tags with a ""X"" stamped on them (positioned somewhere inside each of the frame corners) were used to define alignment of the frame by positioning the string crossings over these ""X""s. Plant genus and species were recorded for top and bottom hits at each point for 1990-1997 data. In 1989, middle hits were also recorded. A plant species hit occurs when a plant part touches a thin metal stick placed at the intersection of 2 filaments in the quadrat. If plant parts of a given species touch the stick at multiple places, only one hit is recorded. In the next sampling year, 2006, and continuing to the present, all hits were recorded at each point, but frame distances were not measured. In addition, exact repositioning of the frame was not possible in some plots due to absence or relocation of tags. Data are formatted as one species hit per row (“string of pearls’)."

The design and location of the nodal plots was described in Pollak et al. (1988). Soil moisture data were collected from the 12 nodal plots weekly during the growing season from 1 June (Julian day 152) 1982 through mid-August 1988. Less-intensive sampling was done during the 1989 growing season. Sampling began when the plots became snow-free. The last sampling date varied among years and depended upon when plants had dehisced, weather, and available personnel. Soil moisture percentages were determined gravimetrically using soil samples collected outside of but adjacent to the ends of the plots (within 0.5 m of plot end). A #6 cork borer (64 mm^2) was used to remove a soil sample from each plot end (two per plot). Samples were taken from the rooting zone to a depth of 5 to 10 cm. A length of 5/8-inch diameter pipe (198 mm^2) was used instead of the cork borer in 1988. If rocks prevented an adequate sample depth, collection of a new sample was attempted nearby. Prior to the 1986 season a metal probe was used to detect below-ground rocks. Extracted cores were pushed into film canisters which were then sealed and labeled. Samples were collected before noon and were weighed within 10 hr. The wet soil samples were placed on aluminum pans, weighed, and oven dried at 100 degrees C for at least 24 hr. Dried soil was removed from the oven and immediately weighed. Prior to 1986 dried soil was placed in a dessicator for 15 min before weighing. Dried soil cores were saved and returned to the core holes. Wet+pan weights, dry+pan weights, and pan weights were recorded. Soil moisture was calculated as (((wet + pan weight) - (dry + pan weight)/((dry + pan weight) - pan weight)) * 100."

  These data describe the spatial definitions of patches of giant kelp,
  Macrocystis pyrifera, in central and southern California, USA, using a
  27-year time series of giant kelp canopy biomass from Landsat 5
  Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (1984-2011). Giant kelp patches were
  delineated using a spatial synchrony-based method that avoids the
  consolidation of adjacent, independently fluctuating local populations
  into ""megapatches"". The method uses a network theory
  modularity approach to optimally cluster Landsat pixels into patches
  based on suitable habitat area (i.e., all areas containing giant kelp,
  1984-2011) and the spatial synchrony of canopy biomass. These data
  were described in Cavanaugh, K. C., D. A. Siegel, P. T. Raimondi, and
  F. A. Alberto. 2014. Patch definition in metapopulation analysis: a
  graph theory approach to solve the mega-patch problem. Ecology

This creates an ideal experimental system in which to study the effects of climate on ecosystems. Such studies are critical givien that the Southwestern U.S. has already experienced changes in climate that have altered precipitation patterns (Mote et al. 2005), and stands to experience dramatic climate change in the coming decades (Seager et al. 2007; Ting et al. 2007). Climate models currently predict an imminent transition to a warmer, more arid climate in the Southwest (Seager et al. 2007; Ting et al. 2007). Thus, high elevation ecosystems, which currently experience relatively cool and mesic climates, will likely resemble their lower elevation counterparts, which experience a hotter and drier climate. In order to predict regional changes in carbon storage, hydrologic partitioning and water resources in response to these potential shifts, it is critical to understand how both temperature and soil moisture affect processes such as evaportranspiration (ET), total carbon uptake through gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem exchange of carbon, water and energy across elevational gradients.We are using a sequence of six widespread biomes along an elevational gradient in New Mexico -- ranging from hot, arid ecosystems at low elevations to cool, mesic ecosystems at high elevation to test specific hypotheses related to how climatic controls over ecosystem processes change across this gradient. We have an eddy covariance tower and associated meteorological instruments in each biome which we are using to directly measure the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. This gradient offers us a unique opportunity to test the interactive effects of temperature and soil moisture on ecosystem processes, as temperature decreases and soil moisture increases markedly along the gradient and varies through time within sites.Data for this project can be found on the website:  http://ameriflux.ornl.gov/"

Several perennial taxa, including tree (Juniperus monsperma and Pinus edulis), shrub (Larrea tridentata) and bunch grasses (Oryzopsis hymenoides (now Achnaterum hymenoides) and Sporobolus contractus) species, were monitored at 1-3 sites differing in elevation and topography as well as edaphic variables and annual precipitation. The sites represented optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular species. Demographic measurements were made biannually, after the 'wet' (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons. For tree and shrub species, estimates of growth and reproduction were based on branch demography, with ten branch tips from 10-20 individuals per species per site repeatedly measured from 1989-1993.Â  For J. monsperma, P. edulis and L. tridentata, vegetative growth (i.e., branch growth) as well as reproduction were monitored. Additional measurements included needle length for P. edulis and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for L. tridentata. For grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction were monitored for 100 individuals per species per site.

We developed a large-scale experimental system that allows testing of the ecosystem impacts of precipitation changes. Four treatments were applied to 1600 m2 plots (40 m × 40 m), each with three replicates in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniper monosperma) ecosystem. These species have extensive root systems, requiring large-scale manipulation to effectively alter soil water availability.  Treatments consisted of: 1) irrigation plots that receive supplemental water additions, 2) drought plots that receive 55% of ambient rainfall, 3) cover-control plots that receive ambient precipitation, but allow determination of treatment infrastructure artifacts, and 4) ambient control plots. Our drought structures effectively reduced soil water potential and volumetric water content compared to the ambient, cover-control, and water addition plots. Drought and cover control plots experienced an average increase in maximum soil and air temperature at ground level of 1-4° C during the growing season compared to ambient plots, and concurrent short-term diurnal increases in maximum air temperature were also observed directly above and below plastic structures. Our drought and irrigation treatments significantly influenced tree predawn water potential, sap-flow, and net photosynthesis, with drought treatment trees exhibiting significant decreases in physiological function compared to ambient and irrigated trees.  Supplemental irrigation resulted in a significant increase in both plant water potential and xylem sap-flow compared to trees in the other treatments. This experimental design effectively allows manipulation of plant water stress at the ecosystem scale, permits a wide range of drought conditions, and provides prolonged drought conditions comparable to historical droughts in the past – drought events for which wide-spread mortality in both these species was observed."

    Several long-term studies at the Sevilleta LTER measure net primary
    production (NPP) across ecosystems and treatments. Net primary
    production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies
    rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are
    important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well
    as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological
    processes. The NPP weight data (SEV 157) is obtained by harvesting a
    series of covers for species observed during plot sampling. These
    species are always harvested from habitat comparable to the plots in
    which they were recorded. This data is then used to make volumetric
    measurements of species and build regressions correlating biomass
    and volume. From these calculations, seasonal biomass and seasonal
    and annual NPP are determined. These sampled are then vouchered for
    use to do analyses of inorganic and organic components such as
    carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous as well as and other macro and
    micro nutrients and organic components such as cellulose and lignin.

  couple the resource dynamics of different primary producers and may
  enhance productivity by reducing loss from the system. In low-resource
  systems, this biotic control may be especially important for
  maintaining productivity. In drylands, the activities of vascular
  plants and biological soil crusts can be decoupled in space because
  biocrusts grow on the soil surface but plant roots are underground,
  and decoupled in time due to biocrusts activating with smaller
  precipitation events than plants. Soil fungi are hypothesized to
  functionally couple the plants and biocrusts by transporting
  nutrients. We studied whether disrupting fungi between biocrusts and
  plants reduces nitrogen transfer and retention and decreases primary
  production as predicted by the fungal loop hypothesis. Additionally,
  we compared varying precipitation regimes that can drive different
  timing and depth of biological activities.
Methodological approach: We used field mesocosms
  in which the potential for fungal connections between biocrusts and
  roots remained intact or were impeded by mesh. We imposed a
  precipitation regime of small, frequent or large, infrequent rain
  events. We used 15N to track fungal-mediated nitrogen (N) transfer. We
  quantified microbial carbon use efficiency and plant and biocrust
  production and N content.

  determine if biocrust cyanobacteria were coupled to plant productivity
  (using plant-derived C mixotrophically), or independent of plant
  activity (and therefore purely autotrophic).

A key factor in a spatially explicit water-balance model is a measure of moisture in the soils over time. This metric is crucial for both calibration and validation of such a model. One of the best methods of measuring soil moisture on a continuous basis is TDR. Therefore, a network of TDR soil moisture sensors was installed at all meteorological stations on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. At two of the sites the sensors were measured on an hourly basis in conjunction with the meteorological variables. At the four other sites the sensors were measured on a much less frequent basis - about every two weeks. Sensors were installed in pits in sets of five.

                                                  audubonii) occur in shortgrass steppe. In 1994, we
                                                  initiated long-term studies to track changes in
                                                  relative abundance of rabbits on the Central
                                                  Plains Experimental Range (CPER). On four nights
                                                  each year (one night each season, usually on new
                                                  moon nights in January, April, July, October), we
                                                  drove a 32-km route consisting of pasture
                                                  two-track and gravel roads on the CPER. This was
                                                  the same route as that driven for carnivore scat
                                                  counts. Surveys began at twilight. Observers with
                                                  two spotlights sat in the back of a 4WD pick-up
                                                  driven at <15 mph. We recorded the
                                                  perpendicular distance (in m) to each rabbit using
                                                  a meter tape or range finder; the direction of the
                                                  rabbit relative to the road; and noted if
                                                  individuals were solitary or in clusters. We also
                                                  recorded any carnivores or other animals seen
                                                  during spotlight surveys. Beginning in Spring
                                                  1998, we recorded the vegetation type (habitat)
                                                  and topographic position of each rabbit seen, as
                                                  well as position relative to human features, eg
                                                  windmills, cattle guards, on the landscape. We
                                                  used the number of rabbits of each species spotted
                                                  per km of route as an index of relative abundance.
                                                  We used line-transect approaches in DISTANCE to

For a complete description of sources and the content of variables you should consult the Data Dictionary on the EcoTrends-Socioeconomic Catalog (http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/trends/catalog_trends_base2.php) since the data collection procedure and sources used where the same. Nichole Rosamilia compiled all the data for the airshed as well as EcoTrends in case you have any particular questions that are not addressed in the data catalog or below.A few points to note on the attached data:1) '-9999' indicates a null value - prior to a given county coming into existence there is no data so it is recorded as null; periodically, and typically for no recorded reason, no data will be recorded or available for a given county so again it is recorded as null.2) the units of measure on certain variables, e.g., CWAGE (commercial establishments), changes over time from dollars, to thousands of dollars, to millions of dollars. Nichole left the data as it appears in the original rather than modify it on entry. For the on-line version we run the data through a script to standardize the units of measure, but that happens later in our data processing.The approximate airshed for the VCR/LTER was based on translation (of the oxidized nitrogen airshed for Shenandoah National Park created by R. Dennis of the Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division of ARL, NOAA and NERL USEPA). The original Shenandoah National Park airshed was digitized from a printed copy, then the centroid of the airshed polygon was moved to from the park to the Virginia Coast Reserve. This was then intersected with ESRI counties data to generate the list of needed counties. A copy of the shapefile and a PDF is included in the ""vcrairshed.zip"" file in the data directory."

Abundant prey at stopovers during migration is a key to shorebird survival and breeding success. We determined which prey were available to foraging red knots (Calidris canutus rufa) using Virginia's barrier islands during spring migration by collecting substrate core samples containing prey on sand and peat substrates in May 2017 - 2019. We also collected red knot feces during the same period and used fecal DNA metabarcoding to determine which invertebrates red knots consumed. We used compositional analysis to determine which prey red knots selected on these islands. Crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida) were the most abundant prey on both sand and peat. Red knots consumed bivalves (Orders Venerida and Mytiloida), crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida), and insect larvae (Order Diptera). Red knots selected bivalves over non-bivalve prey, though non-bivalve prey may still be an important portion of the total caloric intake on Virginia's stopover, given their abundance and use. It is important that coastal conservation practices in the Western Mid-Atlantic stopover region continue to be designed to promote natural barrier island movement which leads to the formation of the peat banks used by many prey."

Statistical prediction of paleoclimate from tree ring widths is challenging because tree ring widths are a one dimensional summary that represents a multi-dimensional set of climate and biotic influences. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework using a non-linear, biologically motivated tree ring growth model to jointly reconstruct temperature and precipitation in the Hudson Valley, New York. Using a common growth function to describe the response of a tree to climate, we allow for species-specific parameterizations of the growth response. To enable predictive backcasts, we model the climate variables with a vector auto-regressive process on an annual time scale coupled with a multivariate conditional auto-regressive process that accounts for temporal correlation and cross-correlation between temperature and precipitation within years. Our multi-scale temporal model allows for flexibility in the climate response through time at different temporal scales and predicts reasonable climate scenarios given tree ring width.

"msb-paleon.16","Settlement-Era Temperature Data, Upper Midwest: Level 1","paleoclimate,temperature,CDMP 19th Century Forts and Voluntary Observers Database Build Project,PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model,principal component regression (PCR)"," Scientific records of temperature and precipitation have been kept for several hundred years, but for many areas, only a shorter record exists. To understand climate change, there is a need for rigorous statistical reconstructions of paleoclimate using proxy data. Paleoclimate proxy data are often sparse, noisy, indirect measurements of the climate process of interest, making each proxy uniquely challenging to model statistically. We reconstruct spatially-explicit temperature surfaces from sparse and noisy measurements recorded at historical United  States military forts and other observer stations from 1820-1894. One common method for reconstructing paleoclimate from proxy data is principal component regression (PCR). With PCR, one learns a statistical relationship between the paleoclimate proxy data and a set of climate observations that are used as patterns for potential reconstruction scenarios. We explore PCR in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, extending classical PCR in a variety of ways. First, we model the latent principal components probabilistically, accounting for measurement error in the observational data. Next, we extend our method to better accommodate outliers that occur in the proxy data. Finally, we explore alternatives to the truncation of lower order principal components using different regularization techniques. One fundamental challenge in  paleoclimate reconstruction efforts is the lack of out-of-sample data for predictive validation. Cross-validation is of potential value, but is computationally expensive and potentially sensitive to outliers in sparse data scenarios. To overcome the limitations that a lack of out-of-sample records presents, we test our methods using a simulation study, applying proper scoring rules including a computationally efficient approximation to leave-one-out cross-validation using the log score to validate model performance. The result of our analysis is a spatially explicit reconstruction of spatio-temporal temperature from a very sparse historical record.

"msb-paleon.17","Settlement-Era Temperature Statistical Model, Upper Midwest: Level 2","paleoclimate,temperature,United States military forts,statistical reconstruction,principal component regression (PCR)"," Scientific records of temperature and precipitation have been kept for several hundred years, but for many areas, only a shorter record exists. To understand climate change, there is a need for rigorous statistical reconstructions of paleoclimate using proxy data. Paleoclimate proxy data are often sparse, noisy, indirect measurements of the climate process of interest, making each proxy uniquely challenging to model statistically. We reconstruct spatially-explicit temperature surfaces from sparse and noisy measurements recorded at historical United  States military forts and other observer stations from 1820-1894. One common method for reconstructing paleoclimate from proxy data is principal component regression (PCR). With PCR, one learns a statistical relationship between the paleoclimate proxy data and a set of climate observations that are used as patterns for potential reconstruction scenarios. We explore PCR in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, extending classical PCR in a variety of ways. First, we model the latent principal components probabilistically, accounting for measurement error in the observational data. Next, we extend our method to better accommodate outliers that occur in the proxy data. Finally, we explore alternatives to the truncation of lower order principal components using different regularization techniques.

"msb-paleon.5","Settlement-Era Tree Composition, Ohio: Level 1","geographic information system,trees,paleoecology,maps","Ohio Township Surveys (OTS) provide spatially aggregated witness tree counts within the town/township polygons that were tallied from early land survey records of town outlines and lotting subdivisions. Overall dates ranged from 1623 to 1870, but varied by town and were recorded about the time of first settlement of the town. A myriad of archived sources were tapped from town, state and national repositories, historical societies and private collections. The SetTreeComp_Ohio_Level1_v1.0 database includes records throughout the domain from the Connecticut Western Reserve at the Connecticut State Archives and various records in the Ohio State Archives collated by Charles Cogbill, the collections of the Ohio Biological Survey through the efforts of Ronald Stuckey and the McLachlan lab at Notre Dame University, and records of the Ohio Land Company by James Dyer and the Marietta College Archives. Every effort was used to avoid duplication of trees. The taxa classes were generally genera or unambiguous categories based on the vernacular names used by the surveyors.  In several cases (black gum/sweet gum, ironwood, poplar/tulip poplar, cedar/juniper), because of ambiguity in the common tree names used by surveyors, a group represents trees from different families and even orders.
